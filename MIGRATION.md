# USTA Foundation → Edge Delivery Services — Migration Log

> **Purpose:** a running, date-ordered record of what we're migrating, where we are, what's done,
> and what's still open. **Read this first.** **Keep it updated as you go** (newest dated entry at
> the bottom). Append an entry whenever you build/change a block, template, or section, or solve
> something non-obvious.

---

## 1. What we're doing

Migrating **https://www.ustafoundation.com/en/home.html** to **Adobe Edge Delivery Services** with
**visual + functional parity across mobile, tablet, and desktop**. Source is an **AEM-classic** site
on **Bootstrap 3** (served via `/etc.clientlibs/…`).

- **Repo / environments:** `main--foundation-usta--aemdemos`
  - Preview: `https://main--foundation-usta--aemdemos.aem.page/`
  - Live: `https://main--foundation-usta--aemdemos.aem.live/`
  - Local dev: `http://localhost:3000`

## 2. Design system (discovered up front)

- **Breakpoints:** `768 / 992 / 1200` — `tools/quality/breakpoints.json`. → `responsive-breakpoints`
- **Grid / units — full deep-dive: [`docs/source-css-system.md`](docs/source-css-system.md).**
  Bootstrap 3: 12-col, **30px gutter**, container **720 / 970 / 1170 (–1200) px** at 768/992/1200.
  **Pixel-first** (~13.4k px vs ~73 rem; root 10px). Spacing scale 4/6/8/10/12/15/16/20/24/30/40px.
  Author block CSS in **px** to match; match by **column span**. → `grid-system`
- **Fonts:** COMPLETE — every face the source uses is self-hosted, in the source's own formats.
  **Graphik** (brand: Regular 400 / Semibold 600 / XXCond Bold 700) wired to `--body/--heading-font-family`;
  secondary source faces **Inter / Barlow Condensed / Anton** self-hosted (`fonts/`, `styles/fonts.css`) —
  wire per component where the source uses them. ⚠️ Graphik proprietary — confirm licensing.
- **Type scale:** recorded in `tools/quality/typography.json` (fonts done; per-breakpoint `scale`
  pending the Playwright `discover:typography` pass). → `typography-system`

## 2a. Site scope & migration plan (which template to target, in what order)

> Full report: **[`docs/MIGRATION-SCOPE.md`](docs/MIGRATION-SCOPE.md)**. Discovery artifacts in
> `catalog/` (`urls-all.json`, `urls-grouped.json`, `urls-sample.json`). Scoped **2026-09-05** via
> **BOTH sitemap + crawl**, merged & deduped.

**Discovery (site-wide):**
- Method: sitemap (`/sitemap.xml` + `/sitemap-index.xml` + `/sitemap-images.xml`, 85 urls) **+** same-host
  Node crawl (65 urls, queue exhausted). Merged, host normalized to `www`, `?form=`/hash/trailing-slash
  stripped → **86 unique content pages + 21 documents** (mostly annual-report PDFs).
- **84% of the site (72/86 pages) is ONE template: news detail** (`/en/home/news/*`). Nail it and the
  site is essentially migrated.

**Template catalog (8 distinct page types):**

| # | Template | Representative URL | Pages | Status |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| T0 | Home | `/en/home.html` | 1 | ✅ done |
| **T1** | **News detail** | `/en/home/news/2023-njtl-essay-contest-winners.html` | **72** | blocks built; needs importer |
| T2 | News listing | `/en/home/news.html` | 1 | cards (news) feed |
| T3 | Section landing | `/en/home/{who-we-are,what-we-do,our-impact,get-involved}.html` | 4 | hero + columns + cards |
| T4 | Leadership & staff | `/en/home/who-we-are/leadership-and-staff.html` | 1 | cards (profile) + tabs |
| T5 | Financials | `/en/home/who-we-are/financials.html` | 1 | **all default content** (h2 + PDF lists) + finalize-assets for 21 PDFs |
| T6 | Special funds / campaign | `/en/home/get-involved/special-funds.html`, `.../young-professional-initiative.html`, `.../chris-evert-50th-anniversary.html`, `.../college-scholarship-opportunities.html` | 4 | cards (expand), quote-image, table |
| T7 | 404 | `/en/home/404.html` | 1 | hero (error) |

Most component blocks already exist (homepage + block-library phase). The remaining work is **per-template
import instrumentation** (parser + `page-templates.json` entry + any section styles), **not** net-new blocks.

**TARGET ORDER (highest leverage first):**
1. **▶ T1 News detail — DO THIS FIRST.** One profile-driven importer instruments **all 72 pages**. Exercises
   already-built blocks: article body (default content) + `social` share bar + `custom-widget-reactions`
   (done) + `custom-content-related-articles` feed + `table`. Build ONE parser, measure the live DOM once,
   bulk-import 72 urls.
2. **T2 News listing** — feeds T1; reuse `cards` (news). Small.
3. **T3 Section landings** (4 pages) — reuse hero + columns + cards + the `center`/`narrow` section styles.
4. **T4–T6 Specialized** (6 pages) — leadership (cards-profile + tabs), financials (default content + wire the
   21 PDFs via finalize-assets), special-funds/campaign (cards-expand, quote-image, table). One profile per
   genuinely-distinct variant; reuse first.
5. **T7 404** — single page, `hero` (error) block already built. Trivial.

**Scope gotchas:** www vs non-www (sitemap lists some no-www; normalized to www). `?form=` urls on
special-funds are Fundraise Up deep-links, not pages (handled by `scripts/donate.js`). News-detail import
completeness will read <100% (duplicate hidden mobile/desktop copies, like the homepage collage) — expected.

## 3. Templates / 4. Sections / 5. Blocks
_Per-template/section/block build details are captured in the dated Log below as they land; the template
landscape + target order is in §2a above (full report: `docs/MIGRATION-SCOPE.md`)._

## 6. Open items / TODO

### Standing
- [ ] **NEXT: build the T1 News-detail importer** (72 pages / 84% of the site) — see §2a target order.
- [ ] Capture + enforce the type scale (see ▶ steps below).
- [ ] Wire the shared grid (`--grid-gap:30px`, `.container-max`, `.grid-*`) into `styles.css` per `docs/source-css-system.md`.
- [ ] Confirm Graphik licensing before publishing.
- [ ] **Re-upload corrected pages to DA (production)** — cards-expand donate hrefs, cards-profile JPEGs, and
  the re-imported home (statement + collage text). This is the USER's step (outward-facing, on request only).
- [ ] Run `npm run check:overflow` + `npm run check:typography` once deps + dev server are up.

---

## ▶ Typography validation — steps (LLM: run these to close the font-size gap)

Font family/files are matched; per-breakpoint **font sizes** (`h1..h6`/body) are **not yet verified**
(`typography.json` `scale` is empty → `check:typography` skips). Once the project is loaded:

1. `npm install` (Playwright + Chromium) and `npx aem up` (localhost:3000).
2. `npm run discover:typography -- https://www.ustafoundation.com/en/home.html --write` — captures the
   source's computed `h1..h6`/body size/line-height/weight/family at every breakpoint. Review, then rely on it.
3. `npm run check:typography` — fix the `:root` size tokens in `styles/styles.css` to match, re-run
   until green. Step type at every breakpoint (768/992/1200), and remember the source is **px-first**.
4. Record the final scale here; re-run `npm run lint` + `npm run check:overflow`.

If `discover:typography` is bot-blocked, add a browser User-Agent to `tools/quality/typography-discover.mjs`.

## Log (newest at the bottom)

### 2026-08-28 — guardrail sync + CSS/grid deep-dive + typography
- **Synced usta to the latest EDS guardrail:** added the Grid Rule + `grid-system` skill +
  `overflow-sweep` (`check:overflow`); the Typography Rule + `typography-system` skill +
  `typography-discover`/`typography-check` (`discover:typography`/`check:typography`); the
  Migration-Log Rule + this log; the Content-Import Rule + `content-import` skill (earlier). Refreshed
  `AGENTS.md`, `package.json`, `skills/README.md`, `quality-tooling`. Preserved `breakpoints.json`.
- **CSS/grid deep-dive** of ustafoundation.com → **[`docs/source-css-system.md`](docs/source-css-system.md)**:
  Bootstrap 3, 12-col/30px-gutter, container 720/970/1170(–1200), **pixel-first** (root 10px),
  spacing scale. Recorded a `grid` block in `breakpoints.json`.
- **Fonts:** confirmed the source's brand font is **Graphik** (already self-hosted + wired — correct).
  Self-hosted the remaining secondary source faces **Inter / Barlow Condensed (R+B) / Anton** so the
  full source set is present; **removed the 4 unused Roboto** files + faces. Recorded all in
  `typography.json`. Type-scale `scale` still pending the Playwright discover pass.

### 2026-09-03 — homepage pixel-parity pass (grid + typography wired globally, logo fix)
**Design-system wiring (global, set once — blocks consume it):**
- **Shared 12-col grid** in `styles/styles.css`: `--grid-gap: 30px`; `.container-max` per-tier widths
  **720 / 970 / 1170** at 768/992/1200 (fluid 100% + 15px gutter on phone); `.grid-12` + `.grid-col-*`
  utilities (spans 3/4/6/8/9). Source-CSS §3 reproduced verbatim.
- **Section container aligned to the source grid:** `main > .section > div` now `max-width: none` +
  15px gutter on phone, then **720 / 970 / 1170** per tier (was `1200` + 24/32px gutters). Every
  section now lands on the source's grid lines — body sections measure **x15 / w1170 @1200** (exact
  source match), was x32/w1136.
- **Typography tokens (per breakpoint, `:root`):** captured the source scale via
  `discover:typography` (UA + `waitUntil:'load'` fix — see below) → `typography.json`. Scale jumps at
  the **768** tier (not 992): h1 54→100, h2 44→76, h3 36→56, h4–h6 18/18/16; body 16→18, **line-height
  a fixed 24px**. Blocks no longer hardcode heading sizes — hero-banner / columns-statement /
  columns-feature now inherit the global h1/h2/h3 tokens (removed their 992px px overrides and
  `line-height:110px` drift). `check:typography` passes clean at **390/768/992/1200**.

**Per-component parity (source vs ours, re-measured at 390/768/992/1200):**
- **Header/nav:** logo restored (see fix); `header nav p` line-height → `--body-line-height` (was `1`,
  which drifted the type check). Nav geometry unchanged (already matched).
- **Hero-banner:** refactored desktop layout onto the tier containers; inner text column sized to the
  **measured source column** — @768 x82/w348, @992 x128/w406, @1200 x145/w510 (**exact**); @390 x15/w360
  vs src x12/w366 (≤6px). Removed the old bespoke `width:763px;max-width:55%`.
- **columns-stats:** already 1170/15px band — matches (x15/w1170 @1200).
- **columns-statement:** intro column x264/w672 @1200 vs src x265/w670 (**1px**); x218/w556 @992 vs
  x222/w549.
- **columns-feature / cards-support (decades/support bands):** now full 1170 at x15 @1200 (exact).
- **Footer:** desktop grid was overflowing (992/1200 → 1207px) from a fixed 290px brand col + 220px
  social + 80px gaps + nowrap nav. Refactored to `237px 1fr auto`, 30px column-gap, responsive logo
  (**180px @992, 210px @1200**, matching the source's small footer logo), nav links wrap < 1200.
  `check:overflow` now clean at all tiers.

**Logo broken in local preview (nav + footer) — root cause + fix:**
- The DA content fragments (`content/nav.plain.html`, `content/footer.plain.html`) wrap each logo/icon
  in a `<picture>` whose `<source srcset>` points to a **different filename** than the `<img src>`
  (an extra hash suffix). **Only the `<img>` file exists locally**; the `<source>` renditions 404, and
  browsers prefer a matching `<source>` over the `<img>` — so the logo/icons render broken. Production
  serves a different fragment shape (`media_<hash>` URLs) so it was unaffected.
- **Fix (block JS, not content):** `header.js` + `footer.js` now strip `<picture> <source>` from the
  fetched fragment (`querySelectorAll('picture source').forEach(s => s.remove())`) so the working
  `<img src>` is always used. Verified: nav + footer logos and all 3 social icons load (naturalWidth > 0).

**Tooling:** added a browser **User-Agent** + switched `waitUntil` from `networkidle`→`load` (source
polls analytics forever, so networkidle timed out) in `tools/quality/typography-discover.mjs`. Added
`/en/home` to `tests/a11y/a11y.config.js` `urls[]`.

**Verification (all green):** `check:typography` ✓ (390/768/992/1200) · `check:overflow` ✓
(360/768/992/1200/1920) · `lint` ✓ (0 errors) · `test:a11y /en/home` ✓.

### 2026-09-03 — per-block typography/font parity audit (every text element × 4 viewports)
Measured **every text element** (title/subtitle/body/label/CTA/caption) on the source vs ours at
**390/768/992/1200** by computed style (ff/fs/fw/lh/letter-spacing/color/align/transform). Found and
fixed the following **real** drifts (the rest already matched):
- **columns-stats:** big number line-height 46→**57** (source 38/57); label font-size was a flat 18 →
  **16 mobile / 18 @768** (global token).
- **cards-support:** card body `p` was flat 18 → **16 mobile / 18 @768**; card text now left-aligns from
  the **768** tier (source does; ours had waited until 992).
- **columns-feature (image-collage "For decades"):** body `p` now left-aligns from **768** (source);
  the centered section title stays centered. **video-card (media):** heading + body now **left-aligned
  at all widths** (was inheriting the block's mobile-centered default); body `p` 18 → **16/18** token.
- **footer:** social/follow `p` 18 → **16/18** token; **KEEP UP** button letter-spacing `0.02em`→**normal**,
  line-height 24→**20**, text-align→**center** (matches source).
- **CTA buttons (hero / feature / card):** line-height `1`→**20px** for exact computed parity (no visual
  change on the fixed 40px flex buttons). Verified hero + feature filled buttons are an **exact** match
  (ff/fs/fw/lh/ls/color/bg/tt/height all identical).

**Note on "same CSS":** this is a lift-and-shift *reproduction* — we adopt the source's **grid,
breakpoints, and computed type scale** as our own tokens/CSS (not their literal stylesheet). Parity is
verified by measuring both sites and diffing every value, not by copying files.

**Method caveat:** a fuzzy text-matching scan produced false "mismatch" rows where a label appears
multiple times (e.g. plain-text nav "WHO WE ARE" vs the filled body button, or a hidden mobile-markup
copy). Always confirm such rows by **visible-element, by-reference** measurement before treating them as
defects. Re-verified: `check:typography` ✓ (390/768/992/1200) · `check:overflow` ✓ · `lint` ✓ (0 errors)
· `test:a11y /en/home` ✓.

### 2026-09-03 — wide-desktop hero + header vertical parity (from side-by-side screenshots)
User's monitor is ~1728–2234px wide; comparison screenshots showed the hero heading wrapping
differently ("Through" on line 1 vs the source's line 2) and the header/hero sitting too high.
Measured both sites at 1200/1440/1600/1728/1920/2200/2560 and found:
- **Hero column is FLUID with a CAP.** Source text column follows `left = 8.333vw+45px`,
  `width = 50vw−90px` for 992→1920, then **freezes at width 870 / left 205** beyond ~1920 — so the
  heading stays "Transforming Lives Through" on line 1 and never lets "Tennis &" join it. Ours had a
  fixed 510px tier (drifted right, always 3 lines past 1200) → replaced with
  `width: min(calc(50vw - 90px), 870px)` + `margin-left: min(calc(8.333vw + 45px), 205px)` and
  **symmetric 208px** top/bottom band padding (band height now follows content: ~874px @3 lines,
  ~740px @2 lines — exactly like the source). Verified line-break + column width match at every width.
- **Header height.** Source nav bar is **128px** (was 120) and the logo renders **294×125** (max-height
  120→125). `<header>` used a fixed `height: var(--nav-height)` which clipped it to 120 and let the hero
  slide under the breadcrumb → changed to `min-height` so the header grows to fit nav(128)+breadcrumb(30)
  and the hero starts at the correct offset (h1Top 328→374 vs source 366; was 38px high, now ~8px).
- **Breadcrumb ("zoomed 3rd row").** Source drives the row height purely from the crumb **line-height**
  (38px phone/tablet → **28px from 1440**, no vertical padding); ours used `padding:8px/14px 20/40px`
  (40px, never shrank). Removed vertical padding + `min-height` floor, set crumb `line-height:38px` with a
  `≥1440 → 28px` tier. Row is now 40px→30px like the source.

Re-verified: `check:typography` ✓ (390/768/992/1200) · `check:overflow` ✓ · `lint` ✓ (0 errors) ·
`test:a11y /en/home` ✓. Hero column width + heading line-break now match the source at
1200/1440/1600/1728/1920/2200/2560.

### 2026-09-03 — hero line-break (nbsp) + nav chevron size (root causes found by rendered-line measurement)
Two remaining screenshot diffs, both traced to their true cause by measuring the LIVE rendered line
boxes/glyphs on both sites (headless font-load pitfall: force `document.fonts.ready` + deviceScaleFactor
2 or the source's Graphik doesn't load and wrap readings lie):
- **Hero heading wrap.** NOT a CSS width issue — the source h1 markup is
  `Transforming Lives Through&nbsp;<span>Tennis & Education</span>`: a **non-breaking space binds
  "Through"↔"Tennis"**, so the browser breaks *before* that clause (after "Lives"). Our migrated content
  lost the nbsp, so ours broke a word later ("…Through" on line 1). Fix in `hero-banner.js`: re-insert a
  U+00A0 (`String.fromCharCode(160)`, to satisfy `no-irregular-whitespace`) before the last three words.
  Verified the rendered first-line width now matches the source **at every width** (266/350/494 across
  390/768/992/1200/1440/1600/1728/1920) — "Through" wraps to line 2 exactly like the source.
- **Nav dropdown chevron.** Source caret is an **18×12** solid triangle (border-left/right **9px**
  transparent + border-top **12px**); ours was a smaller 10×6 (5/5 + 6). Enlarged to match (desktop
  `.nav-drop-toggle::after`).

Re-verified: `check:typography` ✓ · `check:overflow` ✓ · `lint` ✓ (0 errors) · `test:a11y` ✓.

### 2026-09-03 — CTA button widths + nav chevron color (measured on live source)
- **Hero LEARN MORE width.** Source button is a fixed **238×40** (text ~117px + generous fixed width),
  ours was shrink-to-text (~158). Set `width: 238px` + `justify-content: center` on `.hero-banner a.button`.
  Verified x189→right427 = exact source match.
- **Feature CTA widths.** Source WHO WE ARE / WHAT WE DO ≈ **188px**, decades LEARN MORE ≈ **167px**
  (ours were ~166). Bumped `.columns-feature .columns-feature-row a:only-child` padding `4px 18px`→`4px 24px`
  → ~178px (closer to the source's fuller buttons).
- **Nav dropdown chevron color.** Source caret is mid-grey **rgb(110,114,119)**, ours was black. Set the
  desktop `.nav-drop-toggle::after` `border-top-color` to `rgb(110 114 119)` (size already 18×12 to match).
- **Decades collage→text gap.** Measured ours at **40px** (row 1170 = collage 578 + gap 40 + text 552),
  which matches the source proportions; the visible discrepancy in the screenshot was the button width
  above, now fixed. (Source decades section lazy-loads its images, so it can't be measured headless — used
  the screenshot proportions to confirm.)

Re-verified: `check:typography` ✓ · `check:overflow` ✓ · `lint` ✓ (0 errors) · `test:a11y` ✓.

### 2026-09-03 — mobile per-section side gutters (measured at 390px on both sites)
The source does NOT use a uniform mobile gutter — each section is inset differently. Ours used a flat
15px everywhere. Measured both at 390px and matched each section's mobile side gutter exactly:
- **Hero**: 15px → **12px** (`.hero-banner.block` base padding `72px 12px`).
- **Stats black band**: 15px → **27px** mobile (`.columns-stats-wrapper` `padding: 0 27px`, reset to 15px
  at the 768 tier so the desktop 1170 band is unaffected).
- **Statement ("Ready on the court")**: 15px → **53px** (`.columns-statement > div` mobile
  `padding: 24px 38px`; 38 inline + 15 section = 53; reset to `50px 0 80px` at 992).
- **Feature ("We go beyond" / "For decades")**: 15px → **31px** (`.columns-feature` mobile
  `padding-inline: 16px` → +15 = 31; reset to 0 at 992).
- **Support/cards ("Your support makes a difference")**: 15px → **31px** — intro
  `default-content-wrapper` is a direct section child so it takes the full `padding-inline: 31px`; the
  `.cards-support` block sits in the 15px-gutter wrapper so it takes `16px` (=31 total). Both reset to 0
  at 992.

All five sections now measure identical to the source at 390px (12 / 27 / 53 / 31 / 31). The desktop
decades collage→text gap the user flagged is present in the SOURCE too (their screenshot shows the same
whitespace column) and ours already matches within a few px — left as-is.

Re-verified: `check:typography` ✓ · `check:overflow` ✓ (360→1920) · `lint` ✓ (0 errors) · `test:a11y` ✓.

### 2026-09-03 — decades collage→text gap widened to match source
User flagged the gap between the left collage and the right text as too tight vs the source. Measured
ours at 40px (collage 578px, text 552px, 40px gap in the 1170 row); the source reads noticeably wider.
Bumped the image-collage instance row gap 40px → **64px** (`.columns-feature-2-cols:has(.columns-feature-collage)
.columns-feature-row`), so the text now starts ~64px right of the collage (collage right 791 → text left 855
at 1596). Screenshot now matches the source spacing. Gates: overflow ✓ · typography ✓ · lint ✓ · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-03 — `downloads` block (Annual Reports list)
Reusable downloads block: a heading + bulleted list of PDF links, from the financials page
(`.../who-we-are/financials.html`). Authoring contract: heading row (h1–h6, no link) + one row per
download link (a single `<a>` per cell). `decorate()` rebuilds clean anchors into a `<ul><li><a>` so
EDS `decorateButtons()` doesn't convert the standalone `<p><a>` into a `.button` — they stay plain
underlined text links.
- **Heading** "Annual Reports": global h2 tokens (Graphik XXCond Bold, wt 500, 44px/48.4 mobile →
  76px/83.6 ≥768). Source renders it **black**, so override inherited body `#333` → `var(--dark-color)`.
- **List**: `ul` `padding-left:40px`, `list-style:disc`; li color `--text-color` (#333); rows spaced by
  `li + li { margin-top:10px }` (source `p` had 10px bottom margin).
- **Links**: `--link-color` #0357b8, underline, wt 400, **16px mobile → 18px ≥768**, line-height
  **1.4286** (22.857/25.714) — block-specific, NOT the global fixed 24px body line-height (commented).
Measured parity at 390/768/992/1200: font family/size/weight/color/align all match; li a 16→18px exactly.
Gates: lint ✓ (0 errors) · overflow ✓ (360→1920) · typography ✓ · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-03 — `table` block (two-column data table)
Reusable table block from the NJTL essay-contest-winners news page. On the source this is NOT a real
`<table>` — it's two side-by-side `cmp-text` columns (bold `<b>` header, then a flat list of `<p>` with
blank `<p>` separators between groups). We reproduce it as a *generic* semantic table so it's reusable.
- **Authoring contract:** first row = header cells (become `<thead>` `<th scope="col">`); remaining rows =
  data cells (`<tbody>` `<td>`). `decorate()` moves each cell's inner HTML verbatim, so a cell can hold a
  full grouped list of `<p>` (blank `<p>`/`&nbsp;` = 24px group gaps, exactly like source).
- **Styling:** no borders, no background, no cell padding (source has none). Header wt **700**, body wt
  **400**, color pure **black `#000`** (not the body `#333`), left-aligned. Font-size **16px mobile →
  18px ≥768** via `--body-font-size-m`; line-height fixed **24px**; inner `p` margin 0 + line-height 24px.
- **Layout:** mobile-first — cells render `display:block` and stack (24px gap before each column after the
  first). From **768px** the parts switch to `table`/`table-row`/`table-cell` with `table-layout:fixed`
  (equal 50/50 columns) and a **30px** inter-column gutter (`--grid-gap`) via `padding-left` on `td+td`.
Measured parity at 390/768/992/1200: header 700 / body 400, 16→18px, 24px line-height, `#000`, left align,
equal columns, 30px gutter — all exact. Gates: lint ✓ (0 errors) · breakpoint ✓ (table.css only uses 768) ·
overflow ✓ (360→1920) · typography ✓ · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-03 — `quote-image` block (pull-quote + portrait)
Quote-with-image variant from the Young Professional Initiative page (distinct from the text-only
`columns-statement` quote). Bold condensed pull-quote + italic attribution beside a portrait photo.
- **Authoring contract:** one row, two cells — cell 1 = `<h2>` quote + `<p>- <em>Name</em></p>`
  attribution; cell 2 = a single `<img>` (EDS wraps the bare img in a `<p>`, harmless here). `decorate()`
  only tags the row `.quote-image-row` and the cells `.quote-image-text` / `.quote-image-media` (no
  nth-child logic).
- **Layout:** mobile-first — flex column, stacks quote → attribution → image (32px gap above image),
  matching the source's mobile/tablet stack. From **992px** switches to a 50/50 flex row, image right,
  top-aligned, **30px** gutter (`--grid-gap`).
- **Typography:** quote is `<h2>` on the global token scale (44/48.4 mobile → 76/83.6 ≥768, wt 500,
  Graphik XXCond Bold) — NO per-block font-size (source matches the global h2 exactly). Centered on
  mobile, **left ≥992** (source flips center→left at the desktop breakpoint — the mobile/tablet source
  markup used a separate centered copy, desktop a left copy; reproduced with one element + `text-align`).
  Attribution: body 16→18/24, wt 400, **italic**, **right-aligned**, `#000`, `"- Name"` prefix. Image no
  radius, fills column.
Measured parity at 390/768/992/1200: h2 size/lh/weight/family/align and attribution size/lh/weight/style/
align/color all exact; box geometry within grid-gutter tolerance; stacks <992, two-col ≥992. Real source
image URL used (`…/image.coreimg.png/…/ypi-3.png`). Gates: lint ✓ (0 errors) · breakpoint ✓ (quote-image.css
only uses 992) · overflow ✓ (360→1920) · typography ✓ · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-03 — Block library build-out: all pending blocks instrumented (21 blocks) + sample pages
Built every block from the source-of-truth report (`reference/Final Report USTAFoundation.html`) that
wasn't already done, each to source parity across all viewports (390/768/992/1200) with a per-viewport
typography + geometry check, and gave each a browsable sample page under `drafts/block-samples/`.

**Infrastructure (migration-work/, gitignored):**
- Parsed the report → `block-inventory.json` (28 blocks: name, template, source URL, notes) and exported
  all 28 labeled screenshots to `report-imgs/`.
- `gen-sample.mjs` — emits a self-contained EDS draft page per block (the CLI serves `--html-folder`
  files verbatim, so each sample is a full HTML doc loading aem.js+scripts.js+styles.css → decoration
  runs). Pattern: Spacer (so header doesn't overlap) → intro (h2 title + notes + Source: live URL) →
  Spacer → the block → Spacer. Matches the reference block-samples layout.
- `measure-generic.mjs` / `overflow-batch.mjs` — headless per-viewport measurement (forces
  document.fonts.ready + DPR2) and fast overflow sweep.
- `AGENT-BRIEF.md` — the build contract every block followed.

**Blocks built (blocks/<name>/ + drafts/block-samples/<name>.html):**
hero-error, banner-stats, banner-stats-grid, cards-tiles, cards-profile, cards-stats, cards-content,
cards-expand (interactive expand/collapse), cards-news, tabs (interactive + ARIA/keyboard), downloads,
quote, quote-image, quote-tweet (static reproduction of the X embed), table, social (share intents +
clipboard + print), custom-content-related-articles (static feed), embed-instagram (consent-gated),
video-embed (consent-gated YouTube), custom-widget-reactions (local counts), custom-form-donate (static
form UI). Already-done (homepage): header, footer, hero-banner, columns-feature (Columns + Columns
Video), cards-support (Cards Grid), columns-stats, columns-statement, spacer, widget (Custom Widget Donate).

**Third-party embeds** (quote-tweet, embed-instagram, video-embed, custom-form-donate, custom-widget-
reactions) are reproduced as self-contained/consent-gated blocks — NOT live third-party scripts by
default (consent + performance). Documented per block.

**Typography:** every block's text elements matched to the source at all four viewports (family, size,
weight, line-height, letter-spacing, color, align, transform). Headings inherit the global token scale;
block-specific type (e.g. card titles at their own list scale, stat numbers) is set explicitly with a
comment where the source genuinely differs. quote attribution switch moved 992→768 to match source.

**Fixes during integration:**
- Removed the header breadcrumb `@media (width >= 1440px)` line-height tier — it violated the
  Breakpoint Rule (only 768/992/1200 allowed). Breadcrumb crumb line-height stays 38px at desktop.
- cards-expand: `.cards-expand-desc` `overflow: hidden auto` → `hidden` (axe scrollable-region-focusable).
- quote-tweet: underlined inline @mention/#hashtag links inside the tweet body (axe link-in-text-block).

**Verification (all green):** `npm run lint` 0 errors · `breakpoint-check` ✓ (768/992/1200 only) ·
overflow ✓ on all 21 sample pages (360→1920) · `test:a11y` ✓ on all 21 sample pages. Added all 21 sample
pages to `tests/a11y/a11y.config.js` urls[] so the full sweep covers them.

### 2026-09-03 — Block samples moved into the content tree
The block-library sample pages now live in the CONTENT tree at **`content/drafts/block-samples/*.plain.html`**
— a `drafts/` folder alongside `en`, `footer`, `nav` (mirrors the DA block-samples structure). Each page
is a content fragment (Spacer → intro h2 + Source URL → Spacer → block → Spacer → metadata Title).
Generated by `migration-work/gen-content-sample.mjs`. The old repo-root `drafts/` html-folder copies were
removed.

**Serving locally (decorated):** the dev server must mount the content dir at root, preferring the
`.plain.html` fragments:
`npx @adobe/aem-cli up --no-open --html-folder content --html-mount / --prefer-plain-html`
Then each block is browsable at `http://localhost:3000/drafts/block-samples/<name>` (header/footer/nav
decorate; the block decorates live). All 21 pages verified 200 + decorated. a11y config urls already
point at `/drafts/block-samples/*`.

### 2026-09-03 — Added sample pages for the homepage blocks (library now complete: 27 pages)
Added block-sample pages for the already-built homepage blocks so the library covers every authorable
block, not just the pending ones:
- **hero-banner** (Hero), **columns-stats** (Banner Stats), **columns-statement**, **columns-feature**
  in both variants — **columns-feature-video** (Columns Video) and **columns-feature-collage** (Columns),
  and **cards-support** (Cards Grid).
- Markup extracted verbatim from `content/en/home.plain.html` so each sample shows the real homepage
  content/images. columns-feature's variant classes decorate correctly in isolation.
- Header/Footer are global (decorate on every sample already); **Custom Widget Donate** is the global
  FundraiseUp floating tab (loaded via scripts/donate.js) — it already appears on every sample page, so
  it needs no standalone sample. Spacer is used structurally on every sample page.

**Sample-page scaffold fix:** the intro title is now an **`<h1>`** (was h2). EDS derives `<title>` from
the first h1 when no head title exists, so pages whose block has no h1 (columns-*, cards-*, tabs, etc.)
were rendering an empty `<title>` → axe `document-title` (serious). With the h1 intro every page has a
non-empty title and a level-one heading. All 27 sample pages regenerated; re-verified overflow (360→1920)
and a11y (axe) — all pass. a11y config urls[] updated with the 6 homepage pages (27 total).

Full library at `content/drafts/block-samples/` (27): hero-banner, columns-stats, columns-statement,
columns-feature-video, columns-feature-collage, cards-support, hero-error, banner-stats, banner-stats-grid,
cards-tiles, cards-profile, cards-stats, cards-content, cards-expand, cards-news, tabs, downloads, quote,
quote-image, quote-tweet, table, social, custom-content-related-articles, embed-instagram, video-embed,
custom-widget-reactions, custom-form-donate.

### 2026-09-03 — Removed banner-stats duplicate (use homepage columns-stats)
`banner-stats` was a standalone reproduction of the SAME dark rounded stats ribbon that `columns-stats`
already provides on `/en/home` (270+ / 233,000+ / 30+). Per direction, removed the duplicate and kept the
homepage block:
- Deleted `blocks/banner-stats/` (css+js) and removed its a11y-config URL + temp markup.
- The `columns-stats` sample page (`content/drafts/block-samples/columns-stats.plain.html`) — built from
  the real homepage markup — is the single sample for this ribbon.
- **Kept `banner-stats-grid`** — it is a genuinely different block (white 2×2 number/label grid on the
  our-impact page), not a duplicate.
- One file remains for manual deletion (content-dir safety guard blocks agent deletes):
  `content/drafts/block-samples/banner-stats.plain.html` — safe to delete; all code/config refs removed.

Library is now 26 sample pages (was 27).

### 2026-09-03 — columns-stats (stats ribbon) mobile/tablet parity fix (validation pass)
Measured our columns-stats sample vs the live source homepage band at 390/768/992/1200. Typography +
radius already matched; band HEIGHT/geometry drifted on mobile & tablet:
- **Row switch moved 992 → 768.** The source lays the 3 stats side-by-side from the 768 tier (band
  collapses to a compact ~139px row); ours stayed stacked until 992 (367px tall at 768). Now 3-across at 768.
- **Removed band vertical bloat.** Source band has 0 own padding + a 9px top/bottom rhythm and items that
  ABUT (no inter-item gap); item = 97px (num lh57 + label + 8px pad). Ours had `padding:14px` + `gap:24px`
  → too tall. Changed to `padding: 9px 15px` and removed the gap.
- **768 gutter 15 → 24px** (source insets the band 24px at the 768 tier), 15px from 992.

Result — band now matches the source EXACTLY at every viewport: @390 x27/w336/**h309**, @768 x24/w720/
**h139**, @992 x15/w962/**h139**, @1200 x15/w1170/**h115** (num 38/57, label 16→18/24 throughout). This
block is live on /en/home, so the homepage stats band updated too (verified 309/139/115). Gates: lint 0
errors · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ · a11y ✓ (sample + homepage).

### 2026-09-03 — columns-stats typography parity (full per-element audit)
Ran a detailed per-text-element type audit (number + label, both items) vs the live source at
390/768/992/1200. Found and fixed:
- **Font-weight: 700 → 400.** Content authors the figures + labels in `<strong>` (default 700), but the
  SOURCE computes weight **400** (Graphik Regular) for BOTH — measured identically at every viewport. The
  old `p strong { font-weight: 700 }` was wrong (comment claimed "numbers render bold"); numbers are
  distinguished by SIZE (38px) not weight. Set strong → 400.
- **Item width / label wrapping @992.** Source items are ~291px (flex 0 1 auto + `margin: 0 15px`,
  space-around, band with 0 side padding), so "YOUNG PEOPLE SERVED ANNUALLY" wraps to 2 lines. Ours were
  311px (flex:1, band side padding) → label fit on 1 line. Reproduced the source model: band `padding:
  9px 0` at the row tiers, items `flex:1 1 0; margin:0 15px`. Label now wraps to 2 lines @992 like source.

Every text element now matches the source at all four viewports — family (Graphik Regular), size
(number 38/57, label 16→18/24), weight (400), letter-spacing (normal), color (#fff), align (center),
transform (none), AND wrapping/line-count + band height (309/139/139/115). Shared block → homepage
updated too. Gates: lint 0 err · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ · a11y ✓ (sample + homepage).

### 2026-09-03 — banner-stats-grid full typography + layout parity (validation pass)
Per-element audit (heading, featured stat, 2 numbers, 2 labels × 4 viewports = 24 combos) vs the live
our-impact source. Typography (family Graphik XXCond Bold, heading 44→76, featured 54→100, number fixed
90/99, label 36→56, weight 500, accent #418FDE) already matched; LAYOUT differed. Fixed:
- **Number/label alignment** was number-right / label-left; source centers BOTH. Each item is now two
  EQUAL centered halves (`flex:1 1 0` + `text-align:center`, `min-width:0`) so labels wrap within their
  narrow half exactly like the source (e.g. "come from families of need" → 3 lines @768/992, 2 @1200).
- **2-up grid from 768** (was 992) — matches source; item number/label positions now align to source
  (x45/x511 @992, x45/x615 @1200).
- **Content column width**: constrained the block to the source content width (max-width 902 @992, 1110
  @1200) so the heading wraps like the source (2 lines @992, 1 @1200). Featured stat given the source's
  narrower per-tier caps (240 @768 → 4 lines, 669 @992 → 2 lines) so it wraps identically.
- **Overflow fix:** `grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr)` let a wide label push its track past half →
  19px horizontal overflow at 768. Changed to `repeat(2, minmax(0,1fr))` (equal, shrinkable). Clean now.

Result: all 24 element-viewport combos match (family/size/weight/lh/color/align/transform + wrapping/
line-count + item x-positions). Gates: lint 0 err · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ (360→1920) · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-03 — banner-stats-grid wide-desktop + mobile wrap fix (label alignment)
User flagged "coaches, mentors & volunteers" wrapping wrong. Measured across 390/768/992/1200/1260/1409:
- **Wide desktop (≥1260):** a fixed `max-width:1110px` froze the stat columns at 255px so the label
  stayed 3 lines; the source columns keep growing (270px) → 2 lines. Changed the block width to fluid
  `min(970/1170px, calc(100vw - 90px))` so columns widen with the viewport. Now exact at 992/1200/1260/
  1409 (label positions + 2-line wrap match the source).
- **Mobile (390):** briefly switched items to side-by-side then reverted — the source stacks number ABOVE
  label, centered, in one column on mobile. Restored `flex-direction: column` at the base; row from 768.
  Mobile now matches (number over label, both centered).

### 2026-09-03 — banner-stats-grid mobile gutter + typography re-verify
Detailed per-element type audit at mobile (390): all typography ALREADY matched the source (heading
44/48.4, featured 54/59.4, number 90/99, label 36/39.6, weight 500, accent #418FDE / black, centered).
The only diff was CONTENT WIDTH: source insets mobile content ~31px each side (328px column) vs our 15px
gutter (360px), which shifted heading/featured line-breaks. Added `padding-inline: 16px` on the block at
mobile (→31px total, 328px column), reset to 0 at 768. Heading now wraps "…those / who need it the most",
featured "233,000+ young / people served" — exactly matching the source. Desktop tiers unaffected. Gates:
lint 0 err · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-03 — banner-stats-grid mobile paddings/spacing exact fix
Measured mobile (390) box positions + vertical gaps vs source. Fixed the remaining mobile diffs:
- **Number + label were shrink-wrapped** (num1 w101 x145, lbl1 w251 x70) — source spans the FULL 328px
  column, centered. Changed the mobile item from `align-items:center` → `align-items:stretch` so number
  and label are each full-width (text stays centered). Now both w328 x31.
- **Vertical gaps:** heading→featured 40→**32px**; featured→first stat 96→**48px** (grid margin-top);
  number→its label 0→**16px** (item gap). All now match the source (32 / 48 / 16 / 48).
Desktop tiers unaffected (992/1200/1260 num1.x=45, label wrap 3/3/2). Gates: stylelint clean · lint 0 err
· breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ (360→1920) · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-03 — cards-content positional parity (validation pass)
Per-element audit vs what-we-do source. Typography already matched (title Graphik Semibold 18/27 w500;
body Graphik Regular 16→18/24 w400; center@390 / left@768+). Fixed LAYOUT (cards too wide + too little
inset because the block filled our wider section container):
- Constrained the block to the SOURCE content column (fluid min(970/1170px, 100vw−90px) @992/1200; mobile
  padding-inline:16px → 31px inset / 328px; 6px @768 to hit the source 30px gutter).
- Column gap per tier: source 12px @768 (image 168), 30px @992/1200 (image 203→255). Was flat 30px. Set
  gap:12px @768, 30px @992+, minmax(0,1fr) columns.
Result: all 16 element-viewport checks pass — image widths (328/168/203/255), card x-positions, body
line-counts (incl. @992 body now 7 lines). Gates: stylelint clean · lint 0 err · breakpoints ✓ · overflow
✓ (360→1920) · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-03 — cards-expand rebuilt to match the rendered special-funds cards
The live source cards are the FundraiseUp widget (fixed 250×320 tiles in about:blank iframes); the
earlier build cloned that fixed tile AND hid the image on expand. The actual rendered special-funds page
(user screenshots) shows a RESPONSIVE card: image always on top → title + chevron row → full-width blue
DONATE at the bottom; the chevron expands the description BELOW the title (image stays). Rebuilt to match:
- **cards-expand.css:** responsive grid 1-up (mobile) → 2-up (768) → 4-up (992+) on the shared --grid-gap;
  card white/radius 6/soft shadow; image `aspect-ratio 4/3` always visible; title 16/24 w400 #212830;
  DONATE full-width #0373f3 white w600 16/44 uppercase with hover→--link-color. Description expands via a
  `grid-template-rows 0fr→1fr` transition (image no longer hidden); chevron rotates 180°.
- **Donate behavior:** each card keeps its authentic per-fund Fundraise Up campaign code, now RELATIVE
  (`?form=JLLI`/`DINKINS`/`TISDEL`/`RSPA`/`MIDDLESTATES`) so a click stays on our origin and the site-wide
  Fundraise Up widget (scripts/donate.js) opens that fund's overlay (its own image/details) — matching the
  source. Verified: expand keeps image + reveals desc + rotates arrow; aria-expanded toggles; keyboard
  focus-visible on the toggle. Responsive 1/2/4-up confirmed. Gates: stylelint ✓ · eslint ✓ · lint 0 err ·
  breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ (360→1920) · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-03 — cards-expand: fixed-footprint expand (DONATE no longer moves) + card hover-lift
Corrected the expand mechanics after inspecting the source Fundraise Up widget DOM
(.card.hoverable > img.card-image + .card-title[transition:translate] + .card-body + button.btn, card
FIXED 320px):
- **Card footprint is now FIXED (320px)** — on expand the IMAGE is hidden (display:none) and the
  description shows in the freed space; the full-width DONATE stays PINNED to the card bottom (verified
  cardH 320 collapsed = expanded, DONATE doesn't move down). Previously the card grew and pushed DONATE
  down — that was wrong.
- **Hover lifts the WHOLE card** (source `.card.hoverable`): `translate: 0 -6px` + deeper shadow on
  `:hover`/`:focus-within` (was a button-only hover before).
- **Chevron** rotates 180° on expand; `aria-expanded` toggles; keyboard focus-visible on the toggle.
- **DONATE opens the site donate widget** for that fund: each button is `<a href="?form=<CODE>">` (JLLI/
  DINKINS/TISDEL/RSPA/MIDDLESTATES — authentic Fundraise Up campaign codes, relative so donate.js keeps
  them on-origin and the site-wide widget opens that fund's overlay with its own image/details).

### 2026-09-03 — cards-expand fixed-width packing (match source card dimensions)
Measured the source widget cards: FIXED 250×320 (image 242×186 radius 6/6/0/0; title 16/24 w400 padding
20; DONATE 44 line-height, radius 0/0/6/6), laid out flex-wrap + ~4px gap, centered → 4-up desktop / 3-up
@992 / 2-up @768 / 1-up mobile, with the 5th card wrapping centered. Ours had been a stretch grid
(`1fr` → cards 270px, filling the row). Fixed:
- Cards now **fixed 250px** (`flex: 0 0 auto; width: 250px`), `ul` is `flex-wrap; justify-content:center;
  gap: 20px 4px` — cards keep the source width with whitespace, centered, wrapping like the source.
- Added the source corner radii: image `6px 6px 0 0`, DONATE `0 0 6px 6px`.
- Title confirmed 16px/24 w400 (matches source widget); DONATE 16/44 w600.
Removed the responsive 1fr grid media queries (flex-wrap handles columns). Gates: stylelint ✓ · eslint ✓ ·

### 2026-09-03 — cards-expand: break out of section width (4-up parity) + card height 328
Root cause of the persistent mismatch: the block sat inside the section's 970px content wrapper, which
only fit THREE 250px cards per row — the source funds widget spans the full viewport − 60px (30px
gutters, ~1070 @1130) and fits FOUR. Fixed by breaking the block out of the wrapper:
.cards-expand { width: min(1170px, calc(100vw - 60px)); margin-inline: calc(50% - min(585px, 50vw - 30px)); }
Also card height 320 → 328 (source). Verified card rects at 1130px are pixel-identical to the source:
x 59/313/567/821 (4-up) + 440 (5th centered), all w250 h328. Cards-per-row matches at every viewport:
1-up @390, 2-up @768, 3-up @992, 4-up @1130/1200. Gates: stylelint ✓ · lint 0 err · breakpoints ✓ ·

### 2026-09-03 — cards-expand: HOVER-driven reveal (source mechanic) + pinned DONATE
Measured the source with a REAL mouse hover (synthetic events don't fire the widget): the reveal is
HOVER-driven, not a chevron click. On card hover, `.card-title` `translate: 0 -188px` slides the title UP
OVER the image, revealing the `.card-body` description in the freed space; the image stays; DONATE never
moves. Rebuilt to match:
- Title + description slide up on `:hover`/`:focus-within` (also `.cards-expand-open` for click/keyboard);
  chevron rotates 180° on hover. The description is `position:absolute` (no flow space) and DONATE is
  `position:absolute; bottom:0; z-index:2` so it stays PINNED regardless of title height / sliding panel
  (the earlier flex version pushed DONATE 150px below the card).
- Answers to the three reported issues: (1) hovering the card now brings the title/description up like the
  source; (2) no more white gap — the image stays and the title/desc slide over it (was: image hidden on
  click); (3) DONATE stays pinned and opens the fund's Fundraise Up overlay via `?form=<code>`.
Verified via real hover: title→top, desc revealed, DONATE fixed at bottom, card lifts. Gates: stylelint ✓

### 2026-09-03 — cards-expand: card no longer shifts on hover + image flush to top
Two visual fixes from a real-hover comparison against the source:
- **Whole card was lifting on hover.** A leftover `.cards-expand-card:hover { translate: 0 -6px }` moved
  the entire card. The source card stays put — only the panel slides. Removed the card translate; kept the
  shadow-deepen. Verified `getComputedStyle(card).translate === 'none'` on hover; card top/height unchanged.
- **White strip above the image.** The EDS `<p>`/`<picture>` wrappers inside `.cards-expand-image` carried a
  default top margin, pushing the `<picture>` down inside the clipped 186px box. Zeroed `margin`/`line-height`
  and set `display:block` on `.cards-expand-image p, picture`. Verified `imgTop - cardTop === 0` (image flush).
- DONATE per-card: each links to its own `?form=<CODE>` (JLLI/DINKINS/TISDEL/RSPA/MIDDLESTATES); the FundraiseUp
  overlay (fund image + details) is configured in the FRU dashboard and renders on allow-listed origins —
  confirmed the widget tab now injects on the local preview too. This matches the source's per-fund behaviour.

### 2026-09-03 — cards-expand: DONATE button flush to card bottom (white strip removed)
The DONATE `<a>` is wrapped by EDS in a `<p>` (button markup) whose default vertical margin
(~14px top / 4.5px bottom) inflated the footer to 63px, leaving a ~4px white strip below the blue
bar at the card's bottom corners. Zeroed `.cards-expand-donate p { margin:0; line-height:0 }` so the
button IS the 44px footer, flush to the card edge and aligned with the panel's 44px bottom inset.
Verified: footer 63→44px, `cardBottom - donateBottom === 0`, `donateBottom - aBottom === 0`.

### 2026-09-03 — cards-expand: verified per-fund DONATE opens the Fundraise Up overlay
Confirmed (real mouse click, not synthetic) that each card's DONATE opens the Fundraise Up overlay for
that specific fund on the local preview: JLLI click → Judy Levering collage + "Designate to the Judy
Levering Leadership Initiative (JLLI)"; DINKINS click → Dinkins photo + "Designate to the David N.
Dinkins Fund". Click is intercepted (`defaultPrevented=true`), checkout iframes load — exactly like the
source's donate widget. Card hrefs use `?form=<CODE>` (JLLI/DINKINS/TISDEL/RSPA/MIDDLESTATES), matching
the source's `special-funds.html?form=<CODE>` pattern (source codes e.g. TIAFOE/MACKIE/EVERT).
Also hardened `scripts/donate.js`: the `contentWindow`/`contentDocument` getter now wraps `.defaultView`
access in try/catch — reading it on the CROSS-ORIGIN Stripe checkout iframe was throwing SecurityError
(harmless here but could break the widget's own frame access). eslint ✓.

### 2026-09-04 — Block naming: consolidated to base + variant (EDS model)
Refactored the block library to the EDS "small set of baseline blocks + variants" model
(see skills/eds-content-modeling). In EDS, authoring "Cards (content)" yields
`<div class="cards content">` which loads ONLY `blocks/cards/` — so each family was
CONSOLIDATED into one base block whose `decorate()` dispatches on the variant class:
- **cards** ← content (default), expand, news, profile, stats, support, tiles
- **columns** ← feature (auto-detects video/collage sub-layouts), statement, stats
- **hero** ← banner (default, keeps the NBSP h1 line-break bind), error
- **quote** ← (default), image, tweet
Singletons unchanged: banner-stats-grid, social, table, tabs, downloads, video-embed,
embed-instagram, custom-content-related-articles, custom-form-donate, custom-widget-reactions.

Mechanics / gotchas:
- Each base `<block>.js` moved the variant bodies into named helpers (decorateExpand,
  decorateFeature, …) and dispatches via `block.classList.contains('<variant>')`. All
  descendant element classes kept verbatim (`cards-expand-panel`, `columns-stats-img-col`, …).
- CSS: block-ROOT token rewritten `.cards-content` → `.cards.content` (compound class), etc.
  Descendant classes untouched.
- **Section-container rescope (the tricky bit):** EDS derives the section wrapper class from
  the block's FIRST class, so after consolidation `.columns-stats-container` no longer exists —
  it's `.columns-container` shared by all columns variants. Rules that keyed off the old
  per-variant container were rescoped with `:has()`:
  `.columns-stats-container .columns-stats-wrapper` → `.columns-container:has(.columns.stats) .columns-wrapper`;
  `main > .section.hero-banner-container` → `main > .section.hero-container:has(.hero.banner)`;
  and the cross-block adjacency in columns.css:
  `…hero-banner-container + …columns-stats-container` →
  `…hero-container:has(.hero.banner) + …columns-container:has(.columns.stats)`.
- Content updated: home.plain.html + all block-sample .plain.html now author `class="cards content"`
  etc.; sample H1 labels switched to bracket notation ("Cards (content)", "Hero (banner)", …).
- Verified: /en/home renders pixel/type-identical (stats band black+24px radius+17px margin via the
  :has rescope; columns feature still emits BOTH video iframe + collage; cards support → <ul>).

### 2026-09-04 — Asset localization: sample-page images downloaded to content/media-da
The published block-sample pages showed `about:error` for every image: they hotlinked
ustafoundation.com / ucarecdn.com, and DA re-localization broke them (the exact failure the
Asset Localization Playbook warns about). Wrote `tools/assets/localize-assets.mjs` (idempotent,
profile of the playbook) + `docs/asset-localization-playbook.md`, and localized all 8 image-bearing
samples: 30 images downloaded to `content/media-da/drafts/block-samples/{page}/media-{sha1}-{first8}.{ext}`,
src+srcset rewritten to relative `/media-da/…`, ZERO external hotlinks remain, every ref verified
serving 200 locally. Cards-expand fund images (500×376) render locally.
- **DA re-upload required to fix production:** the corrected `.plain.html` docs must be re-pushed to
  DA (media-da stays LOCAL-ONLY, never uploaded) — until then prod still shows the old about:error.
- Heavy source assets flagged (local-only staging, optimize before any prod use): cards-profile has a
  2.8MB SVG, an 815KB SVG, and an 851KB JPEG; quote-image a 683KB PNG.
- Routing check: the header/footer logo correctly links to `/en/home` (verified by real click →
  full homepage renders); `/en/home` is 200 on production. The "not routing home" symptom was the
  broken-image state making the page look dead, not a broken link.

### 2026-09-04 — cards (expand): restored inter-card gap (regression from column-fit tuning)
The card row had `gap: 20px 4px` — the 4px COLUMN gap made the four 250px cards nearly touch,
unlike the source's clear ~20px gutter. Changed to `gap: 20px` (uniform). Four cards still fit
4-across (4×250 + 3×20 = 1060 ≤ 1070 ul); verified card x = 35/305/575/845, colGap = 20px,
5th card centered below. Re-verified DONATE: click on Judy Levering → FundraiseUp overlay for JLLI
(collage image + "Designate to the Judy Levering Leadership Initiative (JLLI)"). Gates: stylelint ✓ ·

### 2026-09-04 — cards (expand): DONATE redirected to home on PRODUCTION (DA strips query-only hrefs)
Root cause found via the published page: on prod every card DONATE resolved to `/url: /` (home), NOT
`?form=<CODE>`. DA/EDS publishing STRIPS a query-ONLY href (`?form=JLLI`, no path) down to the site root.
(The nav DONATE survives because it's an ABSOLUTE url WITH a query — `https://…/?form=DONATE` — DA keeps
the query when there's a real path/host.) So the fund code never reached the Fundraise Up widget and the
link just navigated home.
Fix (two parts):
1. Content: authored each card DONATE as a full path-bearing URL that DA preserves —
   `https://www.ustafoundation.com/en/home/get-involved/special-funds.html?form=<CODE>` (mirrors the real
   source's own hrefs + the working nav DONATE pattern).
2. scripts/donate.js: generalized `wireDonateTriggers()` from `form=DONATE`-only to ANY `a[href*="form="]`
   — it reads the `form` code (via URL API, regex fallback) and rewrites the href to
   `${location.pathname}?form=<CODE>` so the click stays on our origin and the widget opens the matching
   campaign. Nav DONATE still normalises to `/en/home?form=DONATE` (verified, no regression).
Verified locally: real click on Dinkins DONATE → stays on `?form=DINKINS` (no home redirect) → Fundraise Up
overlay for "David N. Dinkins Fund" ("Designate to the David N. Dinkins Fund"). Gates: eslint ✓ · lint 0 err ·
a11y ✓.
**Requires DA re-upload of cards-expand.plain.html for prod to pick up the corrected hrefs.**

### 2026-09-04 — cards (news): mobile side gutters restored to source (390px)
Mobile cards sat flush at the 15px section gutter; source insets the "Related Articles" feed to 31px each
side (content 328 @390) with the card image/text at 36 (a further 5px inline inset). Measured source live
DOM: heading/list x31, image x36. Fixes:
- `.cards.news > ul { padding: 0 16px }` on mobile (15 section + 16 = 31), reset to 0 at ≥768 (3-up row's
  gutters come from the li's 5px inline padding).
- `.cards.news > ul > li { padding: 15px 5px }` (was 15px 0) → image/text land at x36 like the source.
- The authored "Related Articles" <h2> is default content in the same section (0-inset default-content
  wrapper), so it didn't align with the cards; added `.section.cards-container:has(.cards.news)
  .default-content-wrapper { padding-inline: 31px }` (reset at ≥768) to align the heading to the card column.
Verified @390: heading x31, li x31, image x36 (matches source exactly); desktop unaffected (3-up, heading +
first card both x55). Gates: stylelint ✓ · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ (360→1920) · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-04 — Typography parity verified: cards (news) + cards (expand) across all viewports
Measured the SOURCE live DOM at 390/768/1280 and confirmed both blocks match every text metric.
cards (news) — Related Articles feed (source values):
- Title: Graphik Semibold, 28/36 uppercase, letter-spacing -0.7px @≤768 → 22/32 letter-spacing normal @≥992,
  color #000. Date: Graphik Regular 16/20 #000. Description: Graphik Regular 16/24 #000. Read More: Graphik
  Semibold 14/24 uppercase underline #0357b8 @≤768 → 16/24 @≥992. Our CSS already reproduces all of these
  exactly (verified computed styles @390 match 1:1); responsive title/link size steps at 992 confirmed.
cards (expand) — special-funds cards render inside FundraiseUp about:blank iframes; card width is a FIXED
250px at EVERY viewport, so type is invariant across breakpoints (confirmed @390 and @1280 identical):
- Title 16/24 w400 color #212830 none; Description 14/20 w400 #212830; DONATE 16/44 w600 white center.
  Ours matches size/weight/line-height/letter-spacing/color/alignment exactly. ONE deliberate divergence:
  source uses the widget's IBM Plex Sans; we use the site's self-hosted Graphik per the Typography Rule
  (same faces, self-hosted — never adopt a third-party widget font). Metrics identical → wrapping/heights match.
Also fixed tools/quality/typography-check.mjs: it measured the FIRST h3 (a block-internal card title with its
own source-matched scale) against the page h1..h6 scale, flagging false drift. Now it measures page-scale
headings (h1 / default-content / non-block) and skips block-internal titles. Home + both samples pass; no new
eslint errors (file's pre-existing 16 unchanged). Gates: typography ✓ (all 3) · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓

### 2026-09-04 — cards (profile): exact source dimensions across all viewports (was "zoomed")
Measured the source (leadership-and-staff, Staff tab) live at 390/768/1200 — the profile grid is
1-up mobile → 4-up FLUID from 768, on a content column = viewport−60, with a per-tier COLUMN GAP that
opens 12px→30px, and the card row centered (narrower than the container):
- 390: 1-up, card 312, inset 39px each side, image 312²
- 768: 4-up, card 162, gap 12
- 1200: 4-up, card 255, image 255², gap 30
Ours was a stretched 1170 grid → 270px cards ("zoomed") and only 15px mobile inset. Rewrote to match:
mobile single card capped 312 with `padding:0 24px` (15 gutter+24 = 39px inset); 768 tier `max-width:
min(684px,100vw−60)` + `repeat(4,minmax(0,1fr))` gap 12 (→162 cards); 992+ `max-width: min(1110px,
100vw−90)` (=4×255+3×30, the source card row) gap 30 (→255 cards, 255² images). Typography already matched
(name Graphik Semibold 20/28→22/32; role Graphik Regular italic 16/22.9→18/25.7 with the 34×4 divider).
Verified computed rects at all three widths equal the source (card 312/162/255, gap –/12/30, image square).

### 2026-09-04 — cards (profile): typography parity across all viewports (name scale + plain list)
Measured every text element on the source (leadership-and-staff, Staff tab) at 390/768/1280:
| element | mobile 390 | tablet 768 | desktop ≥992 |
| Our Staff (h3) | XXCond Bold 36/39.6 | 56/61.6 | 56/61.6 |
| Name (h4) Graphik Semibold | 20/28 | **18/24** | 22/32 |
| Role (i) Graphik Reg italic | 16/22.86 | 18/25.71 | 18/25.71 |
| Staff list (p) Graphik Reg | 16/24 | 18/24 | 18/24 |
Two fixes:
1. Name font-size is NON-monotonic (20→18→22) — the card narrows to 162px at the 768 tier so the source
   DROPS the name to 18/24 there, then grows to 22/32 at 992. Ours jumped straight to 22/32 at 768 (too big).
   Set base 20/28, added 18/24 at the 768 tier, and 22/32 at the 992 tier.
2. Staff list: source renders it as PLAIN Graphik Regular (16/24→18/24). Our sample authored each line as
   `**Name**, *role*` (bold+italic), which diverged. Stripped the <strong>/<em> wrappers in the sample
   content so the list is plain regular like the source (heading/name/role/list now all match at every width).
Role (16/22.86→18/25.71 italic, with the 34×4 divider), heading, and colors (#000) already matched.

### 2026-09-04 — cards (profile): CORRECTION to the name scale (prior 18/24@768 was a devtools artifact)
The previous entry recorded the card name as dropping to 18/24 at the 768 tier. That reading was WRONG —
it was taken with devtools OPEN. The source title uses AEM's `cmp-teaser__title_scalable`, which shrinks
the font when the layout viewport is squeezed by the open devtools panel (the 18px the user saw). Re-measured
at REAL viewport widths (devtools closed) across 390→1920: the name is 20/28 at ≤~700, then a flat 22/32
from 768 upward (never 18). Reverted the name to 20/28 mobile → 22/32 from 768 (removed the bogus 18/24 @768
and the redundant 22/32 @992 override). Role 16/22.86→18/25.71 and the plain 16/24→18/24 staff list are
unchanged/correct. Verified mine now = source at all widths (name 20/22/22 at 390/768/1200). Lesson: measure
scalable AEM titles with devtools CLOSED (or via a headless context at the true width). Gates: stylelint ✓ ·

### 2026-09-04 — cards (profile): exact name spacing (h4 margin 16/16) + CEO-title myth
Devtools tooltip on the source revealed the h4 uses `margin: 16px 0` (16 top AND bottom) — ours was
`0 0 5px`, so the image→name and name→divider gaps were short. Measured the source's real vertical rhythm
(devtools closed): image→name 16px @mobile / 36px @desktop; name→role-text 37px at all widths (h4 16mb +
description-wrapper 5top + 4px bar + 10 below). Reproduced exactly:
- body padding `0 20px` mobile/tablet → `20px 20px 0` at 992 (source content-wrapper).
- h4 `margin: 16px 0`.
- role <p> `padding-top: 5px` (NOT margin — avoids collapsing with the h4's 16px bottom margin) + bar
  `::before` `margin: 0 0 10px`. Verified mine = source: img→name 16/36, name→role 37/37 at 390 & 1200.
CEO-title "bigger" is a myth: the source title is AEM `cmp-teaser__title_scalable` (JS fits title to card).
With devtools OPEN it recomputes per-card as the panel squeezes the layout, so the inspected/first card reads
a different px (the user saw 18 in one shot, 22 in another for the same design). Measured all 8 cards at real
widths, devtools CLOSED: uniformly 20/28 (≤700) → 22/32 (≥768) — the CEO card is NOT larger. Ours matches
(all 8 uniform). Gates: stylelint ✓ · breakpoints ✓ · typography ✓ · overflow ✓ (360→1920) · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-04 — cards (profile): desktop title sizing = first card 22px, rest 18px (per source scalable title)
Per user direction + the source's AEM `cmp-teaser__title_scalable` behavior: at DESKTOP the first card
(CEO — short name + single-line role) keeps 22/32 while every other card's title renders 18/24 (the longer
names/roles trigger the scalable step-down). Implemented at the 992 tier: base all `.cards-profile-card-body
h4` to 18/24, then `> ul > li:first-child ... h4` back to 22/32. Mobile (390) stays uniform 20/28 and tablet
(768) uniform 22/32 — matching the source at those widths. Verified rendered: 390 first/rest 20/28·20/28;
768 22/32·22/32; 1200 first 22/32, rest 18/24. (Dev server had to be restarted + chromium reinstalled after

### 2026-09-04 — cards (stats): vertical rhythm matched to source (image→number & number→caption gaps)
Measured the source stats band (our-impact.html) at 390/768/1200: horizontal geometry already matched
(image 328 @390 1-up / 270 @≥992 4-up, 30px gap, same 135/135 & 215/215 insets at 1440/1600). The real
diff was the VERTICAL gaps: source image→number is 60px @mobile then 76px @≥768; number→caption 26px. Ours
was a flat 24/24. Fixed: `.cards-stats-card-number` margin-top 60 (mobile) → 76 (from 768 tier);
`.cards-stats-card-caption` margin-top 26. Number (Graphik XXCond Bold 90/99 w500 #000 center) and caption
(Graphik Semibold 18/27 w500 #000 center) typography already matched at all widths — verified 1:1. Verified

### 2026-09-04 — cards (stats): full-bleed cream band + mobile paddings + typography parity
Mobile screenshot review: the source cream band is FULL-BLEED (edge-to-edge) at every width, but ours sat
inside the section's 15px wrapper gutter. Measured source at 390/768/1200/1440:
- band: full-bleed (0/0) all widths; vertical padding 16px @mobile → 32px from 768.
- images: 328 (1-up @390) → 168 (4-up, 12px gap @768) → 270 (4-up, 30px gap @≥992); content column CENTERED
  (image inset 31/30/15/135 at 390/768/1200/1440).
Fixes: `.cards.stats { width:100vw; margin-inline: calc(50% - 50vw) }` (full-bleed escape from the wrapper);
padding 16 mobile → 32 from 768; ul `padding:0 31px` mobile, then centered `max-width: min(708px,100vw-60)`
@768 (gap 12) and `min(1170px,100vw-30)` @992 (gap 30), `repeat(4,minmax(0,1fr))`. Verified band+image geometry
now equals source at all 4 widths, and the vertical rhythm (image→number 60/76/76, number→caption 26) held.
Typography already matched at every width: number Graphik XXCond Bold 90/99 w500 #000 center; caption Graphik

### 2026-09-04 — Section color styles (section-yellow / section-blue) + cards-stats/support parity
Made the band colors block-agnostic SECTION styles (per eds-content-modeling — color on the surface the
block sits on = section style, never baked into a block):
- brand.css: --section-blue-bg #e2f7ff, --section-yellow-bg #ffefbe.
- styles.css: main .section.section-blue (aliased with legacy .highlight) paints the blue band;
  main .section.section-yellow paints the yellow/cream band (pad-V 16px mobile -> 32px @768). Updated the
  home spacer :has() spacing rules to match .section-blue too.
- cards.stats: REMOVED the hardcoded cream bg + full-bleed + pad from the block — the yellow now comes from
  the section-yellow section. Block only lays out its content column (ul inset 16px -> 31px w/ wrapper).
- Content: cards-stats sample + new section-yellow sample use style: section-yellow; cards-support sample +
  new section-blue sample + home (highlight->section-blue) use style: section-blue.
- NEW content/drafts/sections-samples/ (parallel to block-samples): section-yellow.plain.html (wraps
  cards-stats) and section-blue.plain.html (wraps cards-support). Added both to tests/a11y urls.
Circular images now IDENTICAL between cards-stats and cards-support at every viewport (both fluid, centered
content column): 328 @390 -> 168 @768 -> 218 @992 -> 270 @>=1200. Fixed cards-support (was 1-up 688px @768,
fixed 270 causing 992 overflow) to the same fluid 4-up model as cards-stats. Verified circle sizes match 1:1
and home cards-support renders on the blue band. Gates: stylelint OK - breakpoints OK - typography OK

### 2026-09-04 — Typography parity (cards-support, cards-stats) + cards-tiles wrap fix
Typography check across 390/768/1200 (measured source live):
- cards-support: fixed alignment — source TITLE is left-aligned at every width, description + LEARN MORE
  are CENTERED at every width (mine had all-center mobile → all-left from 768). Set h4 text-align:left,
  card center, removed the 768 li left-align. Link font-size now responsive 16→18 (var --body-font-size-m)
  matching source (was fixed 18). Title 18/27 Semibold #000, desc/link 16→18/24 Regular (#000 / #0357b8).
- cards-stats: number Graphik XXCond Bold 90/99 w500 #000 center; caption Graphik Semibold 18/27 w500 #000
  center — already 1:1 at all widths, re-verified.
cards-tiles: source tile TITLE is Graphik Semibold 18/27 w500 #000 CENTER (not left — the screenshot's
"left" look was a centered single-line title on a 270px tile). The real diff was WIDTH/WRAP: my ul was
capped by the 1170 wrapper minus a 30px inline padding → 255px images → "CORPORATE & FOUNDATIONS" wrapped
to 2 lines on wide screens, whereas the source image reaches 270px (fits 1 line) from ~1260px. Removed the
30px inset and capped the ul at min(1170, 100vw−90) so it steps 255@1200 (2 lines, like source) → 270@≥1300
(1 line). Verified 1:1 vs source at 390/768/1200/1300/1440: image 328/168/255/270/270, title lines

### 2026-09-04 — cards (tiles): mobile container cap = source token (clears the Donate button)
Mobile screenshot review: at wider mobile widths the migrated tile image kept scaling with the viewport and
ran under the floating Donate button, while the source card pulls away from the right edge. Root cause: the
source tiles sit in a `.container` with a FIXED max-width on mobile (measured 336px, image 328), CENTERED —
so the image stays 328px and the side margins grow (imgL 31@390 → 51@430 → 86@500). Mine used `padding:0 16px`
which scaled with the viewport. Fixed: `.cards.tiles > ul { max-width: 328px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 0 }`
on mobile (the source image column, centered), and released the cap at 768 (`max-width: min(708px,100vw−60)`,
4-up 168px). Verified 1:1 vs source: image 328 fixed with insets 31/51/86 at 390/430/500 (card now clears the
Donate button exactly like the source); 768 →168 4-up; 1200 →255 (2-line title); ≥1300 →270 (1-line). This is
Option A — the source's own CSS-grid/container token, not an added button-clearance hack. Title typography
unchanged (Graphik Semibold 18/27 w500 #000 center at every width). Gates: stylelint ✓ · breakpoints ✓ ·

### 2026-09-04 — All cards variants: mobile container cap (clear Donate button) — MOBILE ONLY
Applied the same source-token mobile fix from cards-tiles to the remaining variants whose single-column
card SCALED with the viewport (image grew 328→438 @500, staying near the right edge under the floating
Donate button): cards-content, cards-news, cards-stats, cards-support. Source caps each at a fixed ~328px
CENTERED on mobile (measured: content/stats/support image 328, imgL 31@390 → 86@500). Set the mobile `> ul`
to `max-width: 328px` (news 338 = 328 + li's 2×5px), `margin: 0 auto`, removed the scaling `padding: 0 16px`;
each block's existing 768 tier releases the cap (added `max-width: none` on news which only reset padding
before). cards-profile (312 fixed), cards-expand (250 fixed) and cards-tiles (328, prior fix) already capped.
Verified MOBILE-ONLY: all four now 328@390 (imgL 31) → imgL 86 @500 (pulls off the edge, clears the button);
768 and 1200 UNCHANGED (content 168/255 4-up, news 220/360 3-up, stats/support 168/270 4-up). Home
cards-support unaffected (390 →328 1-up, 1200 →270 4-up). Gates: stylelint ✓ · breakpoints ✓ · typography ✓

### 2026-09-04 — cards (profile): fixed DA preview validation (images 2 & 5 were SVG-wrapped rasters)
DA preview rejected images 2 (Kim Borza Donaldson) and 5 (Kasey O'Connor) — "failed validation". Root cause:
the SOURCE serves those two headshots as .svg files (kim-borza-donaldson.svg / kasey-oconnor.svg — 1500x1500
SVGs embedding a raster, 2.8MB & 815KB), while the other six are .jpeg. DA won't validate the oversized
SVG-wrapped rasters as content images. Fix: rasterized both SVGs to 750x750 JPEG via headless chromium
(renders the embedded raster + viewBox like a browser) -> 60KB/58KB, matching the other cards' JPEG format.
Wrote new media-da files (media-c4e978ba / media-593f41ed) and swapped the two src's in
cards-profile.plain.html. Verified all 8 profile images are now JPEG and load (Kim & Kasey at 750px, correct
headshots); zero external hotlinks; new files serve 200. Old .svg files left un-referenced in local media-da
staging (never uploaded to DA per the asset playbook). Gates: check:svg OK, a11y OK, overflow OK, typography OK.

### 2026-09-04 — columns (feature) collage: mobile/tablet thumbnails stack vertically (were side-by-side)
Bug: on mobile/tablet the two collage thumbnails rendered as a horizontal ROW ("1st image attached to 2nd"),
and the tall portrait was shown below them. Measured the source (home.html "For decades" feature) at 390/600:
the two thumbnails are STACKED VERTICALLY (both left-aligned, touching — 0 gap) at every width, and the tall
portrait is a decorative background that is HIDDEN below 992. Fixed the mobile base: `.columns-feature-collage
-stack { flex-direction: column; align-items: flex-start; gap: 0 }` and `.columns-feature-collage-portrait
{ display: none }`; the 992 desktop tier now re-shows the portrait (`display:block`) and opens the stack gap
to 16px (desktop was already correct — unchanged). Verified: 390/768 → thumbs stacked column at the content
inset, gap 0, portrait hidden; 1000/1200 → stacked + portrait beside (unchanged). Home page collage matches
(mobile column/portrait hidden, desktop column/portrait shown) — no desktop regression. Gates: stylelint ✓ ·

### 2026-09-04 — columns (feature) collage: 0-gap stacked thumbs + portrait visible at all tiers
Corrected the collage to the source's per-tier layout (measured on home.html "For decades" at 390/600/768/900/1200):
- DESKTOP (≥992): fixed the stacked-thumbnail GAP from 16px → 0 (source thumbnails TOUCH); [266 stack | 296
  portrait] beside the text (collage flex 574 = 266+12+296).
- MOBILE (<768): [stacked thumbs (0 gap, 156px) | tall portrait 137px] side by side — portrait now VISIBLE
  (was wrongly hidden last change).
- TABLET (768–991): [thumb | thumb] ROW (164px, 12px gap) with the tall portrait (340px) BELOW — portrait
  VISIBLE. Added the 768 tier (stack flex-direction row, portrait full-width below); desktop resets stack
  back to column.
The tall portrait (3rd/decorative bg image) is now shown at EVERY viewport. Verified mine = source at
390/600/768/900/1200 (layout, thumb widths, 0 stack gap, portrait placement) and home page unaffected/correct
at all tiers. Gates: stylelint ✓ · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ (360→1920) · typography ✓ · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-04 — columns (feature) collage: desktop stack→portrait gap 12→15px (source)
Fine-tune: measured the source desktop collage at 1440/1720 — stacked thumbnails 266px, tall portrait 296px,
gap between the stack and the portrait = 15px (mine was 12). Set the desktop collage `gap: 15px` (flex-basis
266+15+296 = 577). Stacked thumbnails still touch (0 internal gap) and portrait 296 — unchanged. Verified
mine@1440 = 266/296/gap 15. Gates: stylelint ✓ · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ (collage + home) · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-04 — columns (feature) collage: heading as default content (centered) + JS fix + tighter text gap
Three fixes on the home + collage-sample "For decades" section:
1. HEADING CENTERED: the "For decades…" h2 was authored INSIDE the block's first cell; the collage JS lifted
   it and wrapped it in `.columns-feature-title`, but it shrink-wrapped (1016px, left-shifted) instead of
   centering. Moved the h2 OUT to be SEPARATE default content above the block (its own full-width H2). Now it's
   1170px, centered. Added `.section.columns-container:has(.columns-feature-collage) .default-content-wrapper
   h2 { text-align: center; margin: 0 0 24px }` (source centers it at every width). Removed the now-dead
   heading-lift + title-wrap logic from columns.js and the `.columns-feature-title` rules.
2. JS PICTURE-GROUPING: after removing the in-cell h2, EDS wrapped BOTH collage pictures in a SINGLE shared
   <p> (cell had no other content), so the old `p.children.length===1` unwrap + `:scope > picture` selector
   found 0 → collage collapsed to a thin strip. Fixed: select `cell.querySelectorAll('picture')` (descendant,
   nesting-agnostic), move each into the stack, then drop empty <p> wrappers. All 3 images render again.
3. COLLAGE→TEXT GAP: the row gap was 64px (too wide — pushed text far right). Source text starts ~8px after
   the portrait; set the collage row gap to `var(--grid-gap)` (30px). Text now lands at 742 (was 776),
   matching the source's tight column.
Verified home + sample: heading centered at 390/768/1200; 2 thumbnails (156/164/266) + portrait render at all
tiers; text gap 30px. Gates: stylelint ✓ · eslint ✓ · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ (home + sample) · typography
✓ · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-04 — columns (feature) collage: heading pure-black + fluid collage on desktop range
Two fixes after the tablet/iPad-Pro (1024) review:
1. HEADING COLOR: after moving the "For decades…" heading to separate default content, it inherited the
   global body color #333 (was #000 when inside the block). Added `color: #000` to the collage section's
   default-content h2 rule → pure black at every viewport (matches source rgb(0,0,0)).
2. FLUID COLLAGE: the desktop collage was fixed 266/296 (flex 0 0), so at 1024 it stayed 266 vs the source's
   222 (source scales the collage with the container across 992–1200, capping at 266/296 from 1200). Made it
   fluid: `.columns-feature-collage { flex: 0 1 49.3%; max-width: 577px }`, stack `flex: 47.3 1 0`, portrait
   `flex: 52.7 1 0` (266:296 proportion, 15px gap). Now scales with the content column (219 in our 970 tier
   ≈ source 222 @1024; 266 from 1200). Verified iPad-Pro 1024 view = collage beside text, black centered
   heading. (Our grid caps the wrapper at 970 for 992–1199 per the adopted breakpoints, so mid-range widths
   track that cap — matches the source within a few px at the tier boundaries.) Gates: stylelint ✓ ·
   breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ (home + sample) · typography ✓ · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-04 — columns (feature) collage: tablet (768–991) collage centered (was big empty block)
The tablet collage was left-anchored in its full 688px cell: thumbnail row + 340px portrait pinned left,
leaving a ~348px empty block on the right (the beige gap the user saw). The source CENTERS the collage
(thumb row + portrait below) in its cell. Fixed: collage `align-items: center` and portrait
`align-self: center` (was flex-start). Now the ~340px collage column is centered with balanced 174px margins
each side at 768/900/991 — matching the source's centered tablet collage; text flows below. Gates: stylelint
✓ · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ (home + sample) · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-04 — columns (feature) collage: carry the desktop 2-col layout through tablet
Per the user: don't use a separate stacked/centered tablet variant for the collage — keep the DESKTOP
two-column layout ([stacked thumbnails | tall portrait] left, text right) from the 768 tier all the way up,
switching to the stacked mobile layout only below 768. Moved the collage's two-column rules (row direction,
left-aligned text, fluid 49.3%/577 collage, stacked thumbnails, portrait) into the `@media (width >= 768px)`
tier, SCOPED to `:has(.columns-feature-collage)`. Critically kept the VIDEO feature ("We go beyond") STACKED
until 992 (source behavior) by scoping its two-column row-flip to a NEW `@media (width >= 992px)
:has(.columns-feature-media)` block — the earlier merge had wrongly flipped ALL feature rows at 768.
Verified: collage 2-col at 768/900/1200 (thumb 156→263 fluid, text beside); video stacked at 768/900/991 →
side-by-side at 1200. Heading pure-black + centered. Gates: stylelint ✓ · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ (home +
collage + video samples) · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-04 — columns (feature) collage: widen container in 992–1199 to match source (tablet parity)
The shared grid caps `main > .section > div` at a flat 970px in the 992–1199 tier, but the SOURCE runs the
"For decades" collage section FLUID there (viewport - 30, i.e. 15px gutter each side, capping at 1170) - so
at 1024 its content is ~994px, giving thumb 222 / portrait 252. Ours was stuck at 970 -> thumb 215 / portrait
240. Widened ONLY this section: `@media (width >= 992px) { main > .section.columns-container:has(
.columns-feature-collage) > div { max-width: min(1170px, calc(100vw - 30px)) } }`. Verified mine now = source
at 1024 (cont 994, thumb 221, portrait 246), 1100 (239), 1200 (263/292) - within 1-6px. Other sections
(video/statement/cards-support) still cap at 970 @1024 (scoping confirmed); no horizontal overflow.
DEVIATION NOTE: intentional, section-scoped override of the shared 970 cap to reproduce the source's own
fluid container for this section - not a grid violation. Gates: stylelint OK, breakpoints OK,
overflow OK (home + sample, 360-1920), a11y OK.

### 2026-09-04 — columns (feature) collage: match source's THREE per-tier layouts (dimensions + positions)
Re-measured the source live DOM across the full range and found it uses three genuinely different collage
layouts — my code was reproducing only two, and the desktop portrait height was wrong. Fixed all:
- DESKTOP (>=992): images LEFT / text RIGHT; inside the image column the two thumbnails STACK vertically
  (touching) beside the tall portrait. KEY FIX: source portrait is a FIXED 401px tall (252x401 @1024,
  296x401 @1199) — TALLER than the ~332 stack, so it sticks out below. Mine had stretched it to the stack
  height (~330). Set portrait `height: 401px`, collage `align-items: flex-start`.
- TABLET (768-991): source LOCKS the section to 720 and REFLOWS — the two thumbnails become a centered ROW
  (164x123, 12px gutter) with the wide portrait (353x401) BELOW them, text column on the right. Mine had
  kept the desktop stacked layout. Rebuilt the 768 tier: collage `flex-direction: column; align-items:
  center; gap:0`; stack `flex-direction: row; gap:12px`; img `width:164px`; portrait `width:100%;
  height:401px`.
- MOBILE (<768): unchanged (156x117 stack | 137x225 portrait, 18px gap, text below) — matches source.
Verified mine == source at 1199/1024/991/880/768/375 (thumb/portrait/text-x all within 1-6px). Gates:
stylelint OK, breakpoints OK, overflow OK (home + sample 360-1920), a11y OK. Screenshots confirm iPad-Pro
portrait now extends below the stack, and tablet shows the row+band reflow.

### 2026-09-04 — columns (feature) collage: tablet gap + portrait width + content-text discrepancy
Compared migrated vs source at IDENTICAL widths (screenshots + geometry, devtools closed) across 768–991:
- GAP collage→text was 30px (var(--grid-gap)); SOURCE is ~14px. Fixed row `gap: 14px` (768 tier only).
- Portrait width was 345 (percentage basis); SOURCE is a fixed 353 in the 720-locked tablet grid. Fixed
  collage `flex: 0 0 353px; max-width: 353px`.
Verified @768/810/900/991: portrait 353=353, gap 14=14, text-x within ~3px (grid 15px vs source 12px outer
gutter — negligible). Gates: stylelint OK, breakpoints OK, overflow OK, a11y OK.
CONTENT DISCREPANCY (needs re-import, NOT a CSS fix): the imported "We support…" body text differs from the
live source wording. SOURCE (exact):
  1) "…organizations THAT use a combination of tennis, education, and life-skills development…"  (mine: "to use")
  2) "…not only benefit from tennis and education, but ARE surrounded by people…"  (mine: "but they are surrounded by")
Flag: content/en/home.plain.html + block sample carry the older copy; regenerate via the import script to
match source verbatim (content is never hand-edited per the Content-Import Rule).

### 2026-09-05 — columns (feature) collage: fix line-wrap via CORRECT source text (parser fix, re-import)
Root cause of the desktop wrap mismatch ("combination" staying on line 1 instead of wrapping to line 2):
the imported body text was the WRONG variant. The source ships TWO near-identical copies of each paragraph
— a hidden mobile copy and the visible desktop copy — differing by a word ("organizations TO use" vs "THAT
use"; "but THEY ARE surrounded" vs "but ARE surrounded"). columns-feature.js deduped by 40-char prefix and
kept the FIRST (hidden mobile, wrong) copy. Fixed the PARSER (never hand-edit content): skip any .cmp-text
inside `aem-GridColumn--default--hide` so the visible desktop copy wins.
While re-importing, discovered the parsers emitted PRE-CONSOLIDATION block names (columns-feature,
cards-support, hero-banner) — which don't match the consolidated blocks/ (columns/cards/hero dispatch on a
space-separated variant class), so the collage stopped decorating entirely. Fixed all 5 parser createBlock
names to the parenthesized form: 'Columns (feature)'/'(statement)'/'(stats)', 'Cards (support)', 'Hero
(banner)' → DA renders class="columns feature" etc. Also added a heading-lift in columns-feature.js: for the
collage instance (cell contains images) hoist the leading <h2> OUT as default content before the block (the
migrated block renders "For decades…" as separate centered default content, per earlier work).
Re-bundled (aem-import-bundle.sh) + re-imported (run-bulk-import --force) + re-localized assets
(localize-assets.mjs, 6 imgs, 0 hotlinks). Verified @1440: text col 563=563, FIRST-LINE 464=464, 4 lines —
"combination" now wraps to line 2 exactly like source; collage decorates; LEARN MORE flush to collage bottom.
Env: had to install Playwright browser build 1208 (validator uses playwright 1.58.2) via the validator's own
playwright-core cli into /ms-playwright.
Completeness reads 83% — the DOCUMENTED dedupe artifact (source text counts both duplicate copies), not
dropped content. Gates: stylelint OK, breakpoints OK, overflow OK, typography OK, a11y OK.
NOTE: content/ is git-ignored; these fixes are reproducible from the parsers/import script, not hand-edits.

### 2026-09-05 — columns (feature) collage: 10px top padding on text column (source parity)
Source starts the text column ~10px BELOW the top of the collage images (first line at y=115 vs collage top
105); mine was flush (offset 0). Added `padding-top: 10px` to the text cell (non-collage row child) in the
768 tier so it applies tablet + desktop. Verified @1440 offset now 10=10; LEARN MORE still flush to collage
bottom (margin-top:auto absorbs the padding, lmVsCollageBottom=0 @1200/1440). Gates: stylelint OK,
breakpoints OK, overflow OK, a11y OK.

### 2026-09-05 — custom-widget-reactions: use source SVG icons (was OS text emoji) + exact spacing
Root cause of the emoji mismatch: the block rendered OS TEXT emoji (😀👍❤️…), which vary by platform/font
and don't match the source. The SOURCE renders each reaction as a fixed SVG from its Vue clientlib
(/etc.clientlibs/usta/clientlibs/clientlib-vue/resources/img/{Smile,Thumbs_Up,Love,Clap,Thumbs_Down,
Light_Bulb}.svg). Self-hosted all 6 SVGs under blocks/custom-widget-reactions/icons/ (447B–4.4KB, well under
budget). JS now renders <img src=icons/{Icon}.svg> (URL resolved via import.meta.url) instead of text; CSS
sizes them by HEIGHT:36px, width:auto so each keeps its source aspect ratio (Smile 36×36, Thumbs_Up/Down
33×36, Love 40×36, Clap 36×36, Light_Bulb 22×35).
Spacing fixes: the buttons carry 4px side padding (+8px between neighbours), so set the flex gap 8px lower —
12px mobile / 52px ≥768 — to land the visual emoji-to-emoji distance exactly on the source's 20 / 60. Set
controls to flex-wrap:nowrap so all six stay on one line at the 360 baseline (source does). Message
line-height set to source: 22px mobile (16px), 25.71px ≥768 (18px), color #6d7278.
Verified @1440/768/375: title 56/56/36 (lh 61.6/61.6/39.6), emoji 36/33/40/36/33/23, gap 60/60/20, message
18/18/16 (lh 25.71/25.71/22) — all match source. Gates: lint 0 errors, breakpoints OK, svg OK, overflow OK
(no wrap 360→1920), a11y OK.

### 2026-09-05 — FIX: mobile horizontal overflow was the HEADER, not cards/columns
User reported horizontal scroll on mobile. Traced it precisely (measured actual window.scrollX after
scrollTo): overflow occurred ONLY below ~355px (320→35px scroll, 344→11px, 360+ clean) — which is why the
360-baseline overflow checker never caught it. Culprit was NOT the cards/columns blocks (cards.tiles correctly
caps at 328 centred, no overflow) but the HEADER nav: its grid `auto 1fr auto` (hamburger/brand/tools) used
the default `1fr` = minmax(auto,1fr), whose `auto` min floors at the logo's intrinsic width; combined with the
fixed hamburger + 124px Donate tools, the nav couldn't shrink below ~355px and pushed page scroll on narrow
phones. Fix (header.css): brand track → `minmax(0, 1fr)` so it can shrink, + logo img `max-width:100%` so it
scales down gracefully on very narrow phones. Verified scrolledX=0 at 280/320/344/360/390/430 on both home and
cards-tiles; logo/Donate UNCHANGED at 360/390 (151/136px logo, 124px Donate) — only shrinks below ~350 (96px
logo @320). Gates: lint 0 errors, breakpoints OK, overflow OK (home+cards-tiles), a11y OK.
NOTE: earlier per-block mobile padding work was correct and is NOT the cause — left as-is.

### 2026-09-05 — SESSION HANDOFF (read § "6. Open items / IN-FLIGHT" first)
State at end of session for the next LLM:
- **DONE & verified this session:** columns-feature COLLAGE fully matched to source across all tiers
  (three per-tier layouts, portrait fixed 401 tall @desktop, tablet reflow to row+band, 10px text top pad,
  text col 563 with LEARN MORE flush to collage bottom); collage body text corrected via PARSER fix (skip
  the hidden mobile copy — `aem-GridColumn--default--hide`); all 5 importer parsers renamed to consolidated
  `'Columns (feature)'`/`(statement)`/`(stats)`, `'Cards (support)'`, `'Hero (banner)'` so DA renders the
  space-separated variant classes the consolidated blocks/ dispatch on; collage H2 lifted to default content;
  custom-widget-reactions now uses the source's own SVG icons (self-hosted in the block's icons/) at exact
  sizes/gaps; mobile horizontal-overflow bug fixed in the HEADER (brand grid track → minmax(0,1fr) + logo
  max-width:100%) — was NOT cards/columns.
- **HALF-DONE (finish first):** Mission Statement → default content. Parser + import config edited; NOT
  re-bundled/re-imported; block JS/CSS + sample still present. Full steps in § 6 IN-FLIGHT.
- **Env gotchas:** dev server: `npx @adobe/aem-cli up --no-open --html-folder content --html-mount /
  --prefer-plain-html`. The parser-validator hook + run-bulk-import use Playwright **1.58.2** → need Chromium
  build **1208**: install via the validator's own cli —
  `cd <excat>/hooks/import-validator && PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/ms-playwright node
  node_modules/playwright-core/cli.js install chromium-headless-shell`. `<excat>` =
  `/home/node/.excat-marketplaces/excat-marketplace/excat`.
- **Expected non-issue:** columns-feature import completeness reads ~83% — the DOCUMENTED desktop/mobile
  dedupe artifact (source counts both duplicate copies), not dropped content.
- **content/ is git-ignored** and delete-guarded — never hand-edit or hand-delete; regenerate via the import
  script. Measure parity at REAL viewport widths with devtools CLOSED (scalable titles shrink otherwise).

### 2026-09-05 — Mobile parity pass: header + columns/cards fixed-width centered columns (source model)
Side-by-side mobile screenshots (source left / migrated right, iPhone 14 Pro Max 430px) surfaced three
defects. Measured the LIVE source at 360/430 (and desktop for regression) to find the true model, then fixed:
1. **Header (blocks/header/header.css):** (a) hamburger icon was BLUE — source is BLACK
   (`Hamburger-Menu-Black.svg`); set `.nav-hamburger button { color:#000 }`. (b) Header sat too tall (128px);
   source is ~105px. Blue top bar 8px→**5px** (source); mobile nav `min-height` 72→**60px**, padding
   `8px 20px`→`0 16px`, gap 16→10px (logo 64px drives the row → ~64px nav). (c) styles.css reserves
   `header { min-height: var(--nav-height) }` = 120px as a CLS floor, which left a ~15px gap below the
   breadcrumb — added a mobile `header { min-height:105px }` override in header.css (desktop tier still grows
   to 128px). Result: header 109px (5 bar + 64 nav + 40 breadcrumb), matches source; hamburger black.
2. **Donate widget overlap + content "shifting left" — SAME root cause.** The floating Fundraise Up tab is
   `position:fixed; right:0; width:53px` (x=377–430). The `columns` variants used VIEWPORT-SCALING gutters
   (`padding-inline`/`padding` tuned at 390px), so at 430px their content was ~40px too wide, drifted left,
   and its right edge collided with the widget. The SOURCE instead lays all mobile content in **FIXED-WIDTH,
   CENTERED columns** (stats band 336, feature/cards 328) so side margins GROW with the viewport (verified:
   stats x12@360→x47@430; card x16→x51). `cards` already did this (matched). Converted `columns` to match
   (blocks/columns/columns.css):
   - `.columns.feature` mobile: `padding-inline:16px` → `max-width:328px; margin-inline:auto` (reset to
     `max-width:none; margin-inline:0` at the 768 tier).
   - `.columns.stats` band: mobile `max-width:1170`→**336px** + `box-sizing:border-box` (so the 15px inner
     side padding stays INSIDE 336, band total = 336 = source); wrapper padding `0 27px`→`0`; released to
     `max-width:1170` at 768.
   - `.columns.statement > div`: kept centered `max-width:810` + mobile inline padding `38px` (inset ~53px;
     source x49@360→x58@430 — a mild grow, 38px splits the range and clears the widget).
   - collage "For decades" default-content H2: capped to `max-width:328px; margin-inline:auto` on mobile
     (was full 400px, so it wrapped wrong), released at 768.
   Verified @430: stats x47/w336 (EXACT source), feature x51/w328, decades x51/w328, statement x58/w314
   (EXACT), cards x51/w328 (EXACT) — all centered, all clear of the widget (right edge ≤379 < widget 377…
   note stats/feature/cards right=379 sits just at the tab's left inset, matching the source's own clearance).
   @360 no regression (stats x12/w336, cards x16/w328); @1200 all release to x15/w1170 (desktop untouched).
3. **Footer typography:** audited source at 360/430/768/1200 — only the "Like us…/follow" text steps 16→18px

### 2026-09-05 — Mission Statement → default content + GENERIC composable section styles (`center`, `narrow`)
Completed the long-standing IN-FLIGHT item AND generalised it per user direction (don't bake a section-
specific `statement` class — make reusable width/alignment section styles).
- **Statement is no longer a block.** `parsers/columns-statement.js` already unwrapped the heading + paragraph
  to default content; re-bundled + re-imported + re-localized so the live/local page now emits plain default
  content + a Section Metadata block — NOT `class="columns statement"` (verified count = 0). Removed
  `decorateStatement()` + its dispatch branch from `blocks/columns/columns.js` and the `.columns.statement`
  rules from `blocks/columns/columns.css` (left a pointer comment).
- **NEW generic section styles in `styles/styles.css` (block-agnostic, composable):**
  - `main .section.center` — centers the section's content column + its text (h1–h6/p → text-align:center,
    color #000). Keeps the default section width unless combined with `narrow`.
  - `main .section.narrow` — constrains content to ONE consistent `max-width:810px` centered measure at EVERY
    viewport (no per-breakpoint width jumps). On phones the standard 15px section gutter keeps it inset; the
    810 cap only engages above ~840px. Meant for sections (default content), NOT blocks — blocks carry their
    own width.
  - Authored together as `style: "center, narrow"` → EDS renders `class="center narrow section"`.
- **Config:** the home-page template is embedded in `tools/importer/import-home-page.js` (NOT read from
  page-templates.json at runtime) — set rc7 `style: 'statement'` → **`'center, narrow'`** THERE (also mirrored
  in page-templates.json for the record). GOTCHA: editing only page-templates.json had no effect; the embedded
  copy in import-home-page.js is the source of truth for the bundle.
- **Sample page** regenerated via `migration-work/gen-content-sample.mjs` (overwrite — content is delete-
  guarded) as a `center, narrow` section-style demo (default content + Section Metadata), replacing the old
  `columns statement` block markup; re-added its a11y URL.
- Verified rendered: statement is centered, 810px narrow, black, consistent x195/w810 @1200, x91/w810 @992,
  full-width-minus-15px-gutter < ~840px, no overflow, matches the source layout. Gates (all green): `lint` 0
  errors · `breakpoint-check` ✓ · `check:overflow` ✓ (home + statement sample, 360→1920) · `check:typography` ✓
  (390/768/992/1200) · `test:a11y` ✓ (home + statement sample).
- **Home-page section-width taxonomy (measured @1200, for future sections):** the source uses just TWO body
  widths — **full grid (1170)** for stats/feature/decades/cards, and **one narrow centered column** for the
  mission statement (670@1200, fluid). Hero is bespoke (own block). So `center`+`narrow` covers the only
  non-default width on the page; everything else stays on the shared 1170 grid.

### 2026-09-05 — custom-widget-reactions: reproduce source hover pill + click + alt text (news page)
Instrumented the reactions widget's INTERACTIVE behaviour to match the source
(`.v-reactions` on the news pages, measured live at
`/en/home/news/2023-njtl-essay-contest-winners.html`):
- **Alt text:** each icon `<img>` now carries its real reaction label as `alt`
  (Smile / Thumbs Up / Love / Clap / Thumbs Down / Lightbulb) — the button's
  accessible name (was `alt=""`). Matches the source's `<img alt="Love">` etc.
- **Hover effect:** on hover (and keyboard focus, for a11y) a black rounded LABEL
  PILL appears above the icon — the "Love" badge in the design. Ported the source
  `.v-reaction__label` values exactly: `position:absolute; top:0`, centered over
  the icon (`left:50%; translateX(-50%)`), `#000 @ 0.8 opacity`, white `12px/24px`,
  `border-radius:15px`, `padding:0 20px`. Replaced the old grey scale-up hover.
- **Click effect:** clicking adds the reaction — a per-icon COUNT value appears
  above the icon (source `.v-reaction__value`: Graphik Semibold 22/30 uppercase
  grey #6d7278) and the message switches from "Be the first to add a reaction" to
  "N Reaction(s)"; `aria-pressed` toggles. Source persists via a backend POST (no
  public API) — counts are client-side only, reset on reload; the visible behaviour
  matches.
- **Structure:** items are `min-height:70px` column-flex (source reserves this so
  the pill/count sit above without shifting the row); controls `flex-wrap:wrap`
  (source), 60px visual icon spacing (52 gap + 4px item padding each side).
- **Overflow gotcha:** the hidden label pills initially used `visibility:hidden`,
  whose boxes still counted toward page scroll-width — the rightmost (Lightbulb)
  centered pill pushed the 360 baseline to 366px. Switched hidden state to
  `display:none` (→ `display:block` on hover) so hidden pills contribute no width.
Verified: alt/accessible-name per icon, hover pill shows the correct label, click
increments count + updates message, keyboard focus reveals the pill. Gates: lint 0

### 2026-09-05 — Added the `center, narrow` SECTION-STYLE sample (sections-samples/)
Section styles belong in `content/drafts/sections-samples/` (alongside `section-yellow`
/ `section-blue`), not only folded into a block sample. Added
**`content/drafts/sections-samples/section-center-narrow.plain.html`** — demonstrates
the composable `center` + `narrow` generic section styles on plain default content
(the "Ready on the court. Ready for life." mission statement), authored via Section
Metadata `style: center, narrow` (no block). Same scaffold as the other section samples
(spacer → intro h1 + notes + Source → spacer → styled section → spacer → metadata Title).
Added its URL to `tests/a11y/a11y.config.js`. Verified: section renders `class="center
narrow section"`, content centered at 810px (x195/w810 @1200), text centered, no overflow.
Gates: overflow ✓ (360→1920) · a11y ✓.
NOTE: the older `block-samples/columns-statement` sample (regenerated earlier as a
center/narrow demo) is now redundant with this canonical section sample; left in place
(content is delete-guarded) — it still renders correctly.

### 2026-09-05 — Removed the `downloads` block → plain DEFAULT CONTENT (heading + list)
The `downloads` block only rendered a heading + a bulleted list of PDF links — which
IS default content. Confirmed on the live source (financials.html): the "Annual
Reports" list is authored as a plain `<h2>` + `<ul><li><p><a>`, no block. EDS only
button-decorates standalone `<p><a>`, never `<li><a>`, so list links stay plain
underlined text links — no block needed.
- **Deleted** `blocks/downloads/` (css+js).
- **Ported the block's styling to GLOBAL default-content rules** in `styles/styles.css`
  (so any prose heading/list matches the source, not just this one page):
  - `main .default-content-wrapper :is(h1..h6) { color: var(--dark-color) }` — source
    renders body-region headings pure black (measured across financials + what-we-do:
    h2/h3/h4 all `#000`); ours had inherited body `#333`. Hero/blocks that need white/
    brand colours already set their own, so this only affects plain authored headings.
  - `main .default-content-wrapper ul { padding-left:40px; list-style:disc }` +
    `li { color:--text-color; line-height:1.4286 }` + `li + li { margin-top:10px }` —
    reproduces the source list (disc, 40px indent, 10px item spacing, 22.857/25.714
    line-height). Placed AFTER the generic `ul` margin rule to satisfy
    no-descending-specificity.
- **Regenerated** `content/drafts/block-samples/downloads.plain.html` via
  gen-content-sample.mjs as default content (h2 + ul, no `downloads` class); kept its
  a11y URL.
- Measured parity vs source @1200: h2 76px XXCond Bold 500 **#000**; links #0357b8 18px
  underline lh 25.71; ul disc/40px; li+li 10px — all exact.

  explicit rules; typography + overflow still pass). Gates: lint 0 errors · breakpoints ✓

### 2026-09-05 — Site scoped (sitemap + crawl) + migration plan → recorded in §2a
Ran full site discovery on https://www.ustafoundation.com/ via BOTH sitemap and crawl (merged/deduped):
**86 content pages + 21 documents**, collapsing to **8 templates**. Key finding: **72/86 pages (84%) are
one template — news detail.** Wrote the full report to **`docs/MIGRATION-SCOPE.md`** and added a permanent
**§2a "Site scope & migration plan"** section to this file (template catalog + recommended target order:
T1 news-detail FIRST, then listing → section landings → specialized → 404). Discovery artifacts saved under
`catalog/` (`urls-all.json`, `urls-grouped.json`, `urls-sample.json`, all schema-valid). The scripted
per-page visual catalog (`template-catalog.json`/`summary.json`) was NOT run — it's a heavy 86-page pass
dominated by 72 near-identical news pages; the decision-useful scope + plan were produced from the discovered
URL structure cross-referenced against the already-built block library. Next actionable step: build the T1
news-detail importer.

### 2026-09-05 — embed-instagram: auto-render the REAL embed (was consent-gated placeholder)
The source (news pages, e.g. newport-njtl-honor-chris-evert.html) renders the FULL live Instagram embed
automatically via Instagram's official `embed.js` — profile header, carousel image, likes, caption. Ours
showed a static "View this post on Instagram" placeholder with a "Load post" consent button, which didn't
match. Per direction ("Instagram should show automatically"), rebuilt to match:
- **JS (`embed-instagram.js`):** on decorate, emit `blockquote.instagram-media` (with a plain `<a>` fallback
  for no-JS) and load `https://www.instagram.com/embed.js` immediately — no placeholder, no button. embed.js
  swaps the blockquote for the live iframe. A MutationObserver adds `title="Instagram post"` to the generated
  iframe (axe frame-title). Removed the whole placeholder-card builder + `loadLiveEmbed`/`skeletonBar`/glyph.
- **CSS:** removed all placeholder-card styles; constrained `.instagram-media` to fill its column
  (`width:100%; max-width:540px`, Instagram's own cap) and left-aligned it on desktop. Kept the source's
  2-col grid: stacked <992, then embed **col-5** (≈458–470) + **30px** gutter + text **col-7** (≈653–670),
  filling the 1170 content width. Text 18px/24 Graphik Regular.
- **a11y:** the live embed's INTERNAL DOM (caption `@mention` link, carousel `cdninstagram` images) throws
  axe link-in-text-block + image-alt — Instagram-served, not ours, and present on the source too. Added
  `iframe[src*="instagram.com"]` to `excludeSelectors` in `tests/a11y/a11y.config.js` (same treatment as the
  already-excluded YouTube/Vimeo iframes); our wrapper + the iframe title are still covered.
Verified @1200: embed col-5 x15/w470, 30px gutter, text col-7 w670 (matches source grid); @390 stacked,
full-width, no overflow; real post renders (tennishallofame 140K, carousel, likes, caption). Gates: lint 0

### 2026-09-05 — embed-instagram: mobile order (embed LAST) + widget-clearing inset + 2-col from 768
Screenshot review of mobile/tablet vs source:
- **Mobile order:** source stacks the article TEXT first and the Instagram embed LAST; ours had embed on
  top. The block is authored embed-cell-first, so used flex `order` (text order:0, embed order:1) to flip the
  visual order without changing DOM/authoring.
- **Side inset for the Donate tab:** added `padding-inline: 16px` on the block row at mobile/tablet (→ 31px
  with the section wrapper's 15px = the source's article gutter), so content clears the floating Donate
  widget. Reset to 0 at the grid tier.
- **2-column from 768 (not 992):** re-measured the source — it goes 2-col at the **768** tier (embed x30/w288
  col-5 + text x330/w408 col-7), not 992 as before. Moved the grid media query to `>= 768px`; embed reverts
  to order:0 (left col-5), text order:1 (right col-7). Verified ours @768: embed w283 (col-5) + text w408
  (col-7) side by side — matches source (text width 408 exact; gutter uses the project's shared 30px
  --grid-gap vs the source's 12px here — kept the shared grid per the Grid Rule).
- Fixed a duplicate `.embed-instagram-embed` selector (merged the order + flex-center rules).
Verified: @390 text-first/embed-last, both inset x31/w328 (clears Donate), no overflow; @768 2-col embed-left/
text-right; @1200 unchanged (col-5/col-7, 1170). Gates: lint 0 errors · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ (360→1920)

### 2026-09-05 — Global mobile FIXED-328px content column (default content never touches the Donate tab)
User: no content — default content or any block — should touch the floating Donate widget on mobile; proposed
a global width rule. Root cause found by box-model measurement at **430px** (not 390): the Donate tab is
`position:fixed` at the right edge, left edge **x377**. The SOURCE lays all content in a **FIXED 328px column,
CENTERED**, so its side margins GROW with the viewport (31px @390 → 51px @430) and the content right edge stays
at **379** — just clear of the tab, at every phone width. Our DEFAULT CONTENT used a viewport-SCALING gutter
(15px, or the reverted 31px), so it widened with the viewport (w368/right399 @430) and ran ~22px UNDER the tab.
(An earlier attempt at a 31px *padding* gutter was REVERTED — a fixed gutter still scales the width; only a
fixed max-width column keeps margins growing. This is the correct fix.)
- **styles.css:** `main > .section > .default-content-wrapper { max-width: 328px; margin-inline: auto;
  padding-inline: 0 }` (released `max-width: none` at ≥768 where the grid container takes over). Same fixed
  328px column the source uses and that our cards/columns blocks already cap to — so ALL content shares one
  mobile measure.
- **section styles:** `main .section.narrow > div` now caps to **328px on mobile** (was a flat 810 that did
  nothing < 810px, leaving the mission statement full-width and un-inset); opens to 810 at ≥768.
- **embed-instagram:** block's mobile `.embed-instagram > div` switched from `padding-inline:16px` to
  `max-width:328px; margin-inline:auto` (released at 768). Text + embed now both x51/w328/right379.
Verified @430 (tab left = 377): home statement / decades / cards-intro / go-beyond headings all x51/w328/
right379; downloads default-content h2 same; embed-instagram text + embed same — every item's right edge (379)
clears the tab (377) with margins that grow on wider phones. @1200 unchanged (statement 810 centered, decades
full 1170). Gates: lint 0 errors · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ (360→1920; home + embed + downloads) ·

### 2026-09-05 — Global mobile 328px column made the SINGLE source of truth (removed per-block padding hacks)
Followed up the previous change: broadened the mobile 328px cap from just `.default-content-wrapper` to the
whole `main > .section > div` (every section content wrapper — default content AND block wrappers). Now ONE
global rule gives every section the source's fixed 328px centered column on mobile, so blocks no longer need
their own donate-clearance insets. Removed the now-redundant per-block mobile hacks:
- `blocks/columns/columns.css`: `.columns.feature { max-width:328; margin-inline:auto }` + its 768 reset.
- `blocks/cards/cards.css`: the `:has(.cards.news) .default-content-wrapper { padding-inline:31px }` +768
  reset, and the `:has(.cards.support) .default-content-wrapper { padding-inline:31px }` +992 reset (kept the
  `text-align:center` + `#000` color those rules also carried).
- `blocks/banner-stats-grid/banner-stats-grid.css`: `padding-inline:16px` +768 reset.
KEPT (genuinely different widths / not donate hacks): stats band `.columns.stats` 336px (own rounded-band
width, wrapper set `max-width:none` so it isn't clamped to 328), cards-news ul 338 (328 + li padding),
cards-profile card 312, cards-expand 250 fixed / full-bleed, and the cards `> ul` 328 caps (they also carry
the grid/flex layout + centering and equal the global 328, so harmless). Full-bleed blocks (stats/cards-stats
bands, cards-expand) escape via their own `width:100vw`+negative-margin on the BLOCK — unaffected by the
wrapper cap. Verified @430 (tab left 377): home stats 336/right383 (band, source-matched), feature/collage/
cards/banner-stats-grid all 328/right379; every touched sample renders in the 328 column and clears the tab.

### 2026-09-05 — hero (error / 404): source blue bouncing-ball SVG + black pill CTA (was green ball + blue btn)
Screenshot review of the 404 hero vs source (ustafoundation.com/en/home/404.html): two mismatches.
- **Illustration:** source is the blue LINE-ART bouncing-tennis-ball **SVG** (`tennis-ball-bouncing.svg`,
  viewBox 128×193, rendered 116×174 desktop), NOT our solid-green CSS `::before` ball. Fetched + self-hosted
  the source SVG at `blocks/hero/icons/tennis-ball-bouncing.svg` (1.4KB, well under budget); `hero.js`
  `decorateError()` now prepends `<img class="hero-error-ball" alt="" aria-hidden>` (decorative; the h1 carries
  the message). CSS renders it centered, width 96 mobile → 116 @768. Removed the old radial-gradient ball +
  bounce keyframes.
- **CTA button:** source is a **BLACK PILL** — `#000` bg, white text, `border-radius: 9999px`, **56px** tall,
  18px Graphik Semibold uppercase +1px letter-spacing. Ours was brand-blue, 40px, radius 3px. Fixed to match.
- h1 already matched (Graphik XXCond Bold 100/110 #000 centered @desktop, via global h1 tokens).
Verified @1200: ball x542/w116 (EXACT source x542/w116), h1 100/110 #000, CTA #000 / radius 9999 / 56px —
all match. Gates: lint 0 errors · breakpoints ✓ · svg ✓ (check:svg) · overflow ✓ (360→1920) · a11y ✓.
NOTE: the block is parity-correct; the repo's `404.html` still ships the EDS BOILERPLATE 404 (big "404" SVG
+ "Page Not Found"), not this block — wiring `404.html` to author the `hero error` block is a separate
follow-up (out of scope for this block-parity task).

### 2026-09-05 — Typography parity validation: quote, quote-image, social, table, tabs, video-embed (all VPs)
Per-text-element typography audit of all six blocks vs their source pages at 390/768/1200 (measured computed
ff/fs/fw/lh/ls/color/align/style + responsive steps). Two blocks had real drifts, fixed; four already matched.
- **quote (blocks/quote/quote.css):** attribution was **weight 700 + italic** → source is **weight 500,
  UPRIGHT** (Graphik Semibold), size **22/24.2 mobile → 28/30.8 @768**, centered #000. Fixed weight,
  font-style, and added the mobile line-height. Quote text already matched (32/48 Graphik Regular wt500
  italic left #000, constant).
- **quote-image:** (a) h2 had a `text-align:left` desktop override → source **CENTERS** the pull-quote at
  EVERY viewport (44/48.4 → 76/83.6 XXCond Bold wt500 #000); removed the override. (b) attribution was
  `font-style: italic` → source is **UPRIGHT** Graphik Regular wt400 right #000 (16/24 → 18/24); the sample
  authors the name in `<em>`, so also added `.quote-image-text p em { font-style: normal }` to undo it.
- **table:** already matches — header wt700 / body wt400, both **16/24 mobile → 18 @768**, #000, left; 30px
  inter-column gutter from 768. No change.
- **tabs:** already matches — tab label 18/22 Graphik Semibold wt400 uppercase #000, padding 0 12px, height
  38, constant across VPs (sage track + black active indicator reproduced). No change.
- **video-embed:** already matches — consent-placeholder message 14/21 Graphik Regular wt400 #333 centered;
  "cookie preferences" link 14px #418fde underlined. No change.
- **social:** icon-only share bar (Facebook/X/LinkedIn/copy/print) — NO visible text on source or ours, so no
  typography to match; geometry already built to parity. No change.

### 2026-09-06 — quote: CORRECTION — attribution is BOLD 700 (prior 500 reading was the h4, not the <b>)
The prior entry set the quote attribution to weight 500 — WRONG. Re-measured with the child selector: the
source attribution is an **`<h4>` wrapping a `<b>`**; the h4 element computes 500 but the VISIBLE text is the
inner `<b>` at **weight 700**. So the name renders BOLD (matches the user's screenshot — source is clearly
bolder than ours was). Reverted `.quote .quote-attribution p` to `font-weight: 700` (kept upright/not-italic,
centered, 22/24.2 → 28/30.8 @768). Verified @390 (22/24.2 wt700) and @1200 (28/30.8 wt700), upright, centered.
Lesson: when the source wraps text in `<b>`/`<em>`/`<strong>`, measure the INNER element — the block-level
computed weight can differ from what's actually painted. Gates: lint 0 errors · overflow ✓ · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-06 — quote: attribution is BOLD + ITALIC (source nests <h4><b><i>, not just <b>)
User flagged the attribution still looked wrong — the source is bold AND slanted. Walked the FULL element
chain: the source nests `<h4>` > `<b>` > **`<i>`** — the innermost `<i>` computes **italic 700**. My prior
walk stopped at the `<b>` (700, upright) and missed the `<i>`, so I'd wrongly set `font-style: normal`.
Restored `.quote .quote-attribution p` to `font-weight: 700` + **`font-style: italic`** (Graphik Semibold,
black, centered, 22/24.2 → 28/30.8 @768). Verified @1200 (28/30.8 wt700 italic) + @390 (22/24.2 wt700 italic),
screenshot confirms the slant matches the source. Lesson reinforced: walk to the DEEPEST text-bearing element
(`<h4><b><i>`), not just the first wrapper — each nested tag can add weight/style.

### 2026-09-06 — quote-image: attribution is ITALIC (source wraps it in <i>) — reverted the upright override
Same deep-element issue on quote-image: the source attribution is `<p>` > **`<i>`** — the `<i>` computes
**italic**, weight 400, Graphik Regular, 16/24 @390 → 18/24 @1200, right, #000. In the earlier pass I'd wrongly
set it upright + added `.quote.image .quote-image-text p em { font-style: normal }`. Reverted: attribution `p`
is now `font-style: italic` and removed the em-normalize rule (the sample's `<em>` now renders italic like the
source `<i>`). Verified @1200 (18/24 wt400 italic right) + @390 (16/24 wt400 italic right); quote h2 unchanged
(44→76 XXCond Bold wt500 centered). Gates: lint 0 errors · overflow ✓ (360→1920) · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-06 — quote.tweet: source is a BARE blockquote (no card, no bird) + new `float-left` section style
User's source/migrated screenshots showed our tweet as a bordered CARD with a Twitter bird glyph — the SOURCE
renders it as a **bare blockquote** (the platform.twitter.com widget never upgrades the markup): plain tweet
text + inline blue links, then a plain "— Name (@handle) Date" line, NO border/background/radius/shadow and
NO bird. Measured on the live source (carol-ngounoue-runner-up-wimbledon-event.html) at 390/768/1200:
padding **10px 20px**; body/footer `<p>` Graphik Regular wt400 **#333** left, **16/22.857 → 18/25.714 @768**;
links **#0357b8** wt400 (date link 17.5/25 — a hair smaller in-source, we normalize to body size); footer sits
one blank line (~1× line-height) below the body.
- `blocks/quote/quote.js` `decorateTweet()`: removed the bird SVG; now just tags row0 `quote-tweet-body`,
  row1 `quote-tweet-footer`.
- `blocks/quote/quote.css` `.quote.tweet*`: stripped ALL card chrome + the `.quote-tweet-bird` rules; set the
  bare-blockquote type scale above. Inline body links keep an underline (WCAG link-in-text-block) — a minimal,
  documented deviation from the source's color-only links so axe passes; the standalone handle/date links stay
  clean like the source.
- **New block-agnostic section style `float-left`** (`styles/styles.css`): reproduces the source article that
  embeds a tweet mid-copy (the 3rd screenshot). Because EDS splits a section into separate wrappers
  (heading → block → body text), floating the block's wrapper lets the FOLLOWING default-content paragraphs
  reflow around it — **no block-in-block needed**. @≥768 the section becomes an 810px centered container and the
  first non-default-content wrapper floats left (width 350, max 45%, 30px right gutter); MOBILE stacks (no float,
  global 328px column). Sample: `content/drafts/sections-samples/section-float-tweet.plain.html`.
Verified: tweet renders as bare blockquote (border/bg/radius/shadow all 0/none, no bird) matching source values
@1200 + @390; float sample — tweet floats left (x195–545), body first line insets to x575 (30px past the float)

### 2026-09-06 — CORRECTION: tweet-in-article is a TWO-COLUMN split, NOT a float (`float-left` → `split-left`)
The prior `float-left` entry was wrong. User's source/migrated screenshots showed two problems: (1) I'd
NARROWED the section to 810px — it should stay the DEFAULT page content width (720/970/1170, same as the home
page); (2) with a float, the taller text column wrapped its tail paragraphs BACK UNDER the tweet (full-width),
"spreading" the content. Measured the LIVE source at 1200: the blockquote and the body text are **two equal
independent columns** (each 555px, 30px gutter, same top) — `float:none` on both; the text NEVER flows under
the tweet. So the correct model is a 2-col GRID, not a float.
- Replaced `.section.float-left` with **`.section.split-left`** (`styles/styles.css`): @≥768 the SECTION becomes
  the centered default content-width grid (720/970/1170 per tier — as wide as the home page), `grid-template-
  columns: 1fr 1fr`, 30px gutter, `align-items:start`. Wrappers are grid items: default content spans both
  columns (heading row); the block wrapper → col 1 / row 2; the `.default-content-wrapper` that FOLLOWS the
  block (`~` sibling) → col 2 / row 2. MOBILE (<768) stays `display:block` so everything stacks in the global
  328px column (tweet then body). No block-in-block needed — the section grids EDS's own per-wrapper divs.
- Sample `content/drafts/sections-samples/section-float-tweet.plain.html` updated to `style: split-left`.
Verified @1200: section 1170px full width, tweet left col (15→585) + text right col (615→1185), same top (763),
30px gutter, text column taller (bottom 1219) and stays entirely right — no wrap-under. @390: stacks, both
328px. Gates: lint 0 errors · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ (360→1920) · typography ✓ · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-06 — quote.tweet: blank line between body paragraphs (source uses <br><br>)
User flagged the missing gap below "What an experience! Still taking it all in." The source blockquote is a
SINGLE `<p>` that separates its two sentences with a **double `<br>`** (one blank line ≈ one line-height). Our
body is authored as two separate `<p>` with `margin:0`, so there was no gap. Added
`.quote.tweet .quote-tweet-body p + p { margin-top: 22.857px }` (→ 25.714px @768) so the gap between body
paragraphs equals one line-height, matching the source's blank line (only BETWEEN paragraphs, not after the
last). Verified @1200: 26px gap between the two body paragraphs. Gates: lint 0 errors · breakpoints ✓ ·

### 2026-09-06 — columns (default): image captions + smart image-side (left/right)
Source (carol-ngounoue article) places body text in one column and an image WITH a caption in the other; the
default columns block had TWO gaps: (1) NO caption handling — an authored caption paragraph just rendered as a
stray italic <p>; (2) the image could ONLY sit left — the CSS pinned the image column with `order:0` and gave
the other cell `order:1` (reset to `unset` only on the non-image cell at 992), so authoring the image second
still forced it left.
- `blocks/columns/columns.js` `decorateDefault()`: for any cell containing a `<picture>`, wrap the image (+ the
  following caption paragraph, if any) in a semantic `<figure class="columns-figure">` / `<figcaption
  class="columns-caption">`, moving caption content (inline links preserved), then replace the cell contents.
  Dropped nothing else — the image SIDE now simply follows the AUTHORED cell order (image cell first = left,
  second = right), since the row lays out in DOM order.
- `blocks/columns/columns.css`: removed the `order:0/1/unset` overrides (they broke image-right) and the now-dead
  `.columns-img-col` img rule; base `.columns > div` at ≥992 changed `align-items: center → start` (so a short
  text column top-aligns with a tall image, like the source) and dropped `order:unset`. Added `.columns-figure`
  (margin 0) + `.columns-caption` styled to the source figure caption: Graphik Regular **16/22.857**, wt400,
  **#333**, left, **upright** (`em`→normal), **4px** below the image.
Sample: `content/drafts/block-samples/columns-caption.plain.html` — two blocks: text-first (image RIGHT, matches
the source screenshot) and image-first (image LEFT). Verified @1200: block0 image right (612→1185) + block1 image
left (15→588), caption 16/22.857 #333 upright 4px below image on both; @390 stacks in authored order, image+
caption together, 328px. Regression: columns-feature-collage/-video/-stats/-statement overflow ✓ (base-rule

### 2026-09-06 — columns (default): vertical gap between stacked cells on mobile/tablet
The stacked layout (<992) had `flex-direction:column` with NO gap, so the image/caption butted directly against
the body text. Moved the `gap: 24px` up from the ≥992 rule to the base `.columns > div` so it applies in BOTH
states: stacked (mobile+tablet) it's the vertical gap between the text cell and the image/caption cell; from 992
the row goes horizontal and the same gap sits between the columns. Verified 24px gap @390 and @768. Gates: lint

### 2026-09-06 — columns (default): reframed as a MEDIA column (caption optional)
Per feedback, the feature is a two-column block with a MEDIA (image) column — the caption is optional, not the
defining trait. No code change needed: `decorateDefault()` already wraps any picture cell in a `<figure>` and
only adds a `<figcaption>` when a caption paragraph is present, so a media cell with no caption renders the image
alone (verified: block with a bare `<picture>` → `<figure>` with just the `<img>`, no empty figcaption). Added a
clearer sample `content/drafts/block-samples/columns-media.plain.html` showing BOTH: image-right WITH a caption
(text cell first) and image-left with NO caption (image cell first). Verified @1200 both render correctly; gates:

### 2026-09-06 — social: icon row alignment is viewport-dependent (centered <768, left ≥768)
User's source/migrated mobile screenshots differed: ours left-aligned the 5 share icons at ALL viewports; the
SOURCE (.v-social-media-sharing) CENTERS them on mobile and only left-aligns from 768. Measured the live source
across the 768 boundary: at 767 the group is `display:block; text-align:center` (icon row centered in the 328px
column — mobile icons span x75→315 of 31→359); at 768 it flips to `inline-block; text-align:start` (row starts
at content-left x30). Icon geometry constant everywhere: 48×48 buttons, 12px padding, 0 gap (they abut); the
source wraps the bar in `padding: 8px 0`. Earlier MIGRATION note ("left-aligned, constant across viewports") was
wrong for mobile.
- `blocks/social/social.css`: `.social-bar` base `justify-content: center` (mobile) + `padding: 8px 0`; added
  `@media (width>=768px){ justify-content: flex-start }`. Icon size/padding/gap unchanged (already matched).
Verified our sample @390: bar 31→359, icons centered 75→315 (240px row), 48×48, 8px vpad — matches source
mobile exactly; @768: left-aligned (icons start at content-left). Gates: lint 0 errors · breakpoints ✓ ·

### 2026-09-06 — table: header is NOT bold + 24px header→body gap (source is plain two-column text)
User's source/migrated screenshots differed. Measured the live source (2023-njtl-essay-contest-winners): the
"Winners"/"NJTL Chapter" header is NOT a bold table header — it's plain body text (Graphik Regular, weight 400,
18/24, black), just the first line of each column, followed by a 24px BLANK LINE (empty in-column <p>) before
the first group. Our table block rendered the header as `<th>` at weight 700 with NO gap to the body — two
visible mismatches. Body typography already matched (18/24, wt400, black, margin 0; source cols 555px + 30px
gutter → our fixed table-layout + `--grid-gap` padding reproduces this).
- `blocks/table/table.css` `.table thead th`: weight 700 → **400**; added **padding-bottom: 24px** to reproduce
  the source's blank-line header→body separation (works even when no blank <p> is authored). Merged into one rule
  to avoid a duplicate-selector lint.
Verified across viewports: @1200 header wt400 + 24px gap to first group; @390 stacked (header wt400, 24px gap,
all 328px); @768 two columns side-by-side (360px each), header wt400, 24px gap. Gates: lint 0 errors ·

### 2026-09-06 — Typography parity sweep across ALL block samples (non-heading text elements)
Ran the automated h1..h6/body checker across all 27 block samples — ALL pass at 390/768/992/1200. Then did
deep per-ELEMENT source-vs-migrated measurement (buttons, captions, labels, dates, tab labels, stat numbers,
CTAs — things the global checker doesn't cover) via Playwright at 3 viewports. Delegated measurement to parallel
subagents, then VERIFIED every reported drift on the live source myself (subagents made several errors — see
"rejected" below). Genuine, source-confirmed drifts fixed:

GLOBAL (root cause of most drift): source DEFAULT body/copy text is pure **BLACK** (rgb(0,0,0)), measured on
article + home templates; ours used `--text-color: #333` on `body`. Changed `styles/styles.css` `body` color and
`main .default-content-wrapper li` color to `var(--dark-color)` (#000) — WITHOUT touching the `--text-color`
token (still #333, correctly used by quote-tweet body + columns image caption, which measured #333 on source).
This one change fixed the grey drift on: columns-statement body, tabs panel body, cards-profile staff list.

BLOCK-SPECIFIC:
- columns-feature-collage: body `<p>` was forced `text-align:left` (collage override) — source is **center**.
  Removed the `.columns.feature:has(.columns-feature-collage) h3, p { text-align:left }` override (base
  `.columns.feature p` is already center = source).
- cards-support: LEARN MORE authored as `<a><strong>` rendered bold+no-underline; source is regular-weight
  underlined blue link. Added `.cards.support …a strong/b { font-weight:400; text-decoration:inherit }`.
- custom-widget-reactions: source TEXT (title + prompt) is LEFT-aligned; only the emoji controls row is centered.
  Changed the block from all-centered to `align-items:stretch; text-align:left` (controls keep their own
  `justify-content:center`). "Be the first" color already matched (#333 both).
- columns-statement (sample authoring bug): the `center, narrow` Section Metadata was in a SEPARATE section div
  from the h2/p, so the style never applied (left + grey). Fixed the sample so metadata sits in the content
  section → now center + black like source.

REJECTED (subagent claims that were WRONG on live-source re-measurement, left unchanged): h2 does NOT shrink to
44px at 1200 (source = 76px/83.6 at 1200, matches our recorded scale + checker); collage CTA letter-spacing 1px
is CORRECT (it's a blue button, not a plain link); cards-profile role IS italic on source (inner `<i>`), our
italic is correct; related-articles/cards-news date weight is 900 at mobile/tablet but 400 at desktop — a real
responsive change but on the single-weight "Graphik Regular" face (synthetic bold, negligible), left as-is.

Verified all fixes at 390/768/1200 on the migrated samples (tabs body #000, collage body center+#000, cards-
support CTA wt400+underline, reactions text-left + emoji-centered, cards-profile staff #000 + role italic #000,

### 2026-09-06 — NEW block `toc-profile` (replaces "tabs" with a scroll-spy anchor TOC) + section-metadata camelCase fix
The source Leadership & Staff page uses "tabs" (Staff / Board of Directors) that each just reveal a different
SECTION. Per direction, replaced the tab pattern with a page-level table-of-contents: a sticky anchor bar that
scroll-spies real sections — so each entry targets a whole SECTION that can host ANY blocks (no block-in-block,
which EDS can't author). Adapted from a provided petrobras `master-toc`; renamed per request to **`toc-profile`**
(block) with metadata key **`profile-anchor`** (dataset `profileAnchor` → attr `data-profile-anchor`), CSS classes
`toc-profile-*`. USTA-branded: active entry gets a **brand-blue** underline (not petrobras green); tab text is
18px Graphik Semibold uppercase (matches the source tab row).
- `blocks/toc-profile/toc-profile.js`: parse `label | slug` rows → sticky nav; bind targets by
  `data-profile-anchor` (falls back to heading-token match); IntersectionObserver scroll-spy; smooth
  click-scroll (respects 56px header offset); scroll-progress bar; reveal-on-scroll `.is-stuck` (fixed below
  header); horizontal scroll + arrows on mobile overflow; prefers-reduced-motion → instant. English a11y labels.
- `blocks/toc-profile/toc-profile.css`: in-flow tab strip (sage underline track) → `.is-stuck` fixed bar
  (top:56, centered content width, shadow). Mobile: `overflow-x:auto` + edge arrows; ≥768 static strip.
- **`scripts/scripts.js` `decorateSectionMetadata` FIX (load-bearing):** it set `section.dataset[toClassName(key)]`
  — `toClassName('profile-anchor')` stays hyphenated, and `dataset['profile-anchor']=…` THROWS a SyntaxError
  ('not a valid property name'), which would break decoration for ANY hyphenated metadata key. Switched to
  `toCamelCase(key)` (→ `profileAnchor` → the `data-profile-anchor` attribute). Verified existing `style`-based
  section metadata (split-left, center/narrow) still applies with no regression. (Only `style` keys had been used
  before, so this latent bug never fired until now.)
- Sample: `content/drafts/block-samples/toc-profile.plain.html` — replicates leadership-and-staff: intro h1 +
  toc-profile bar (Staff / Board of Directors); a `staff` section = Cards (profile) 8-up grid + staff text list;
  a `board-of-directors` section = Cards (profile) 2-up (Chris Evert, Kathleen Wu) + Officers/Advisory/Honorary
  lists. Board content transcribed from the live source's Board tab. (Board portraits reuse staff drafts images
  as placeholders — real headshots would arrive via import.)
Verified @1200 + @390: both sections bound (`data-profile-anchor`), TOC renders, scroll-spy activates the right
entry (Board active when scrolled into view), bar goes fixed at top:56 once scrolled past, click smooth-scrolls
to the section, progress bar tracks scroll; mobile nav scrolls horizontally (arrows appear only on overflow).

### 2026-09-06 — toc-profile: match source tab strip exactly (no sticky/progress) + align content to cards
User feedback on the toc-profile parity. Measured the live source tab row at 1200 and fixed:
- REMOVED the sticky "moving bar at top" and the scroll-progress bar (those were master-toc example-only; not on
  the USTA source). The strip now stays in flow.
- Tab metrics → source: `padding: 0 12px` (was 8px 20px), height 38px, tabs abut (gap 0), 18px Graphik Semibold
  uppercase black.
- Underline system → source uses a full-width **6px sage (#dcdfcf) track** + a single **6px BLACK indicator**
  (computed rgb(0,0,0), not blue) that SLIDES under the active tab. Replaced the per-tab `border-bottom` toggle
  (which just appeared/disappeared) with one absolutely-positioned indicator translated via `transform`+`width`
  with a `0.3s` transition → seamless movement matching the source. `blocks/toc-profile/toc-profile.js` now sets
  `is-active` + `moveIndicator()`; syncs on init/resize/load; reduced-motion disables the transition.
- Verified indicator settles exactly under the active tab (Staff: left15 w78; Board: left93 w224 — exact).
- CONTENT ALIGNMENT: source lays heading ("Our Staff"/"Board of Directors") + cards + lists in ONE column whose
  left edge matches the first card. Ours had the heading/lists at the section edge (left 15/31) while the cards
  inset (45/55) → misaligned. Added `main .section:has(.cards.profile) .default-content-wrapper` rules to match
  the card inset: 24px padding on mobile (matches the card `ul` padding), then the centered max-width column
  (684 @768, 1110 @992) with padding reset. Now heading = image = list left at every viewport
  (55/55/55 @390, 42/42/42 @768, 45/45/45 @1200).

### 2026-09-06 — table `directory` variant (3-column name directory) + section wrapper spacing
Two asks on the Board of Directors layout:
1. NEW table variant `directory` — a multi-column name directory (source Board panel: "Officers and Directors /
   Advisory Board / Honorary Board"). Measured live @1200: 3 columns (~330px each, ~60px gaps, thin vertical
   divider between), headings 28/30.8 Graphik Semibold black (10px below), names 18/24 body black with the NAME
   bold (`<b>`) + role italic (`<i>`), lines separated by `<br>`.
   - `blocks/table/table.js`: dispatch on `.directory` → `decorateDirectory()` tags each authored cell as a
     `.table-directory-col` (flattening multi-row authoring column-wise), adds `table-directory-N-cols`. Default
     variant unchanged (still builds the semantic `<table>`).
   - `blocks/table/table.css`: `.table.directory` = CSS grid, 1 col mobile → N cols from 768 with a 60px column
     gap and a 1px divider drawn in the gap (border-left + negative margin). Heading/name/`<b>`/`<i>` styling per
     source.
   - Sample: `content/drafts/block-samples/table-directory.plain.html`. Also swapped the toc-profile sample's
     Board plain-list default content for this directory table.
2. SECTION SPACING — EDS gives every block/default-content wrapper `margin:0`, so a block sat flush against the
   next block/content (heading→cards→list all ~14px on our page; the source clearly separates them, e.g.
   cards→directory ~66px). Added `styles/styles.css`: a wrapper that FOLLOWS a block wrapper gets `margin-top`
   (32px mobile → 40px ≥768). Scoped to `div[class$="-wrapper"]:not(.default-content-wrapper) + div[...-wrapper]`
   so a lead-in HEADING before a block keeps its tight gap (only space AFTER blocks), matching the source rhythm.
Verified @390/768/1200: directory 3 cols (stacks on mobile), bold names + italic roles, dividers from 768;
spacing now heading→cards ~9–14px (source ~17) + cards→list/directory 32/40px (was 14). Gates: lint 0 errors ·

### 2026-09-06 — toc-profile: TAB behaviour (show one section, hide others) + bar parity confirmed
User saw BOTH sections stacked (Board of Directors visible while on Staff). The source is a real TAB SET — only
the active panel shows. Reworked `blocks/toc-profile/toc-profile.js`: removed the scroll-to + IntersectionObserver
scroll-spy; `setActive()` now toggles `section.hidden` so ONLY the active `profile-anchor` section renders and the
others are hidden (initial = first entry, or the URL hash if it names a panel — honours the source's #tab= deep
link). Tabs get `role=tab` / nav `role=tablist`. Removed now-unused HEADER_OFFSET + prefersReduced (lint).
Bar/border parity re-measured on the live source @1200 and confirmed identical to ours: full-width 6px sage track
(#dcdfcf), 6px BLACK sliding indicator, tabs 38px tall / `padding:0 12px` / 18px Graphik Semibold uppercase,
indicator left15·w78 under Staff → left93·w224 under Board. Bumped the indicator transition 0.3s→0.5s to match
the source. (The apparent "thicker bar" in the migrated screenshot was just 2× DPR, not a real size diff.)
Verified @1200 + @390: load shows only Staff (Board hidden); clicking Board hides Staff + shows Board; indicator
matches the active tab at both; screenshot confirms the strip matches the source. Gates: lint 0 errors ·

### 2026-09-06 — cards.profile: match source card body padding + card-height behaviour
User flagged the profile cards' internal positioning/dimensions differed from source. Re-measured live @1200:
card 255px, img 255×255 square, 30px col gap, box-shadow rgba(0,0,0,.5) 0 2px 5px, name indent 20px — ALL
already matched. The two real diffs:
1. img→name gap: source **16px** (just the h4's 16px top margin) but ours was **36px** — the desktop card body
   had `padding: 20px 20px 0` adding 20px on top. Changed to `padding: 0 20px` (keep the 20px side inset only).
2. Card height: source cards HUG their content (a 3-line role makes only THAT card taller; others stay short —
   measured 471/477/471/471). Our grid stretched all cards to the tallest (default `align-items:stretch`),
   padding empty space below short cards. Added `align-items: start` to `.cards.profile > ul`.
Verified @390/768/1200: img→name 16px, role→card-bottom ~10px (source ~11), cards hug content (heights vary by

### 2026-09-06 — toc-profile: fix published-page spacing (space above bar, tab→panel gap, orphaned spacers)
On the pushed EDS page the tab section had 3 spacing faults (root cause: the sample authors intro+bar in one
section and separate spacer sections around each panel; when a tab hides a panel, its spacers orphan):
- NO space above the bar (intro→bar 5px): added `.toc-profile` `margin-top` 48px mobile / **77px ≥768** (source
  content→tab-row gap) + small `margin-bottom`.
- HUGE tab→panel gap (125–185px): the hidden panel's bordering spacers stayed, and the toc + spacer + panel
  section margins stacked. Fixes in `styles.css`: (a) hide spacers bordering a hidden panel
  (`.spacer-container:has(+ .toc-profile-panel[hidden])` and the after-variant); (b) hide any spacer directly
  after the toc section; (c) zero `.toc-profile-container` bottom margin and cap the visible panel's top margin
  to **32px** (source). JS marks each panel section `.toc-profile-panel` (AFTER the entries loop populates the
  panels map — the earlier bug was marking before it was populated, so the class never applied).
- Result is uniform: tab-row→panel heading = 45px @1200 / 32px @390 for BOTH tabs (source ~32).
Also confirmed the bar/indicator geometry already matches source (6px sage track #dcdfcf + 6px black sliding
indicator, tabs 38px, 0 12px padding) — the "black border" seen was the pre-fix published state.

### 2026-09-06 — toc-profile: track + indicator as flush siblings (fix doubled/offset bar)
User saw an inconsistent black underline with an "extra layer" over the sage track. Cause: the sage track was
the nav's `border-bottom` and the black indicator was `position:absolute; bottom:-6px` overlaying it — a
border + negative-offset overlay can drift a subpixel (esp. at mobile DPR), reading as a doubled/offset line.
Fix: made BOTH the track and indicator absolutely-positioned sibling spans at `bottom:0; height:6px` inside a nav
with `padding-bottom:6px` (source model — a `.cmp-tabs__background-border` + `.cmp-tabs__border`). JS now creates
a `.toc-profile-track` span alongside the indicator; CSS drops the border for a full-width `.toc-profile-track`
and moves the indicator to `bottom:0`. Verified pixel-flush @390 + @1200: track+indicator share the same
bottom/height, indicator matches the active tab left/width, track full-width. Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓ ·

### 2026-09-06 — cards.profile: img→name gap (desktop 36) + tight staff list (typography parity)
Two source-parity fixes on the profile cards + staff list:
1. IMAGE→NAME gap: source = 16px mobile/tablet, **36px desktop** (≥992: content-wrapper adds 20px top + h4's
   16px margin). I'd previously flattened this to 16px everywhere (padding `0 20px`). Restored the 20px top
   padding but ONLY at ≥992 (`.cards.profile .cards-profile-card-body` → `padding: 20px 20px 0`); mobile/tablet
   keep `0 20px` (16px). Verified 16/16/36 @390/768/1200.
2. STAFF LIST line spacing: the source packs the plain-text list tight (18/24, NO inter-line gap); our default-
   content `<p>` rhythm added ~14px between lines. Added `main .section:has(.cards.profile)
   .default-content-wrapper p { margin:0; line-height:24px }` → 0 gap at all viewports, matching source.
(Also fixed a stray CSS syntax error introduced when the cards-stats block comment opener got clipped.)
Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ (toc-profile + cards-profile) · typography ✓ · a11y ✓.
NOTE: the source also italicises the ROLE portion of each staff-list line (`Name, <i>role</i>`); ours is plain
because the DA-authored content has no <i> — that's a content change (not CSS) and would need editing on DA.

### 2026-09-06 — toc-profile: mobile tabs fill row width (indicator reaches edge on active BOARD)
User: on MOBILE the black indicator should extend to the right edge (as in source screenshot 3), and the
tab→bar gap. Measured source @390: the two tabs GROW to fill the 328 track (STAFF 91, BOARD 237 = full width),
so the active BOARD indicator reaches the right edge; STAFF's does not. Desktop keeps tabs natural-width,
left-packed. Ours had `flex: 0 0 auto` at all widths (tabs 78+224=302 < 328) so BOARD stopped short on mobile.
Fix (`blocks/toc-profile/toc-profile.css`): base `.toc-profile-item` → `flex: 1 1 auto` + `justify-content:
flex-start` (mobile: equal-share growth, text stays left); `@media (width>=768px)` → `flex: 0 0 auto` (natural
width). tab→track gap was already 0 (flush) both source + ours. Verified @390: STAFF 91 / BOARD 237 (fills 328),
BOARD indicator reaches right edge, STAFF doesn't; indicator matches active tab; screenshot confirms. @1200:
unchanged (natural width 78/224, left-packed). Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-06 — toc-profile: more gap between tab text and the bar (align text to top)
User wanted more space between the STAFF/tab text and the sage bar below. Measured source: tab is 38px tall but
the text sits near the TOP (line-height 22), leaving ~21px below the text before the track; ours centered the
text, leaving only ~13px. Changed `.toc-profile-item` `align-items: center → flex-start` so the text sits at the
tab top — text→track gap now 21px at mobile + desktop, matching source. Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓ · overflow
✓ · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-06 — NEW section style `split-right` + video-beside-article sample
Added a `split-right` section style (mirror of `split-left`): default-content TEXT in the LEFT column, a block in
the RIGHT column, two equal columns at the page content width (720/970/1170), 30px gutter, from 768; mobile
stacks (text → block). Authored text-first so reading order is text→video on mobile; grid places the block into
col 2 / row 2 and the preceding default content into col 1 (`:has(~ …-wrapper)`), so no block-in-block.
`styles/styles.css` after the split-left rules. Sample: `content/drafts/sections-samples/section-split-right-
video.plain.html` — the Community Impact Hub article body (Brian Vahaly quote) in the left column + a Video
Embed (consent placeholder) on the right, per the source screenshot. Verified @1200: text 15→585 / video 615→
1185, same top, 30px gutter (mirrors source); @390 stacks text→video (both 328). Video placeholder unchanged
(14/21 #333 centered, blue link, 16:9). Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ (split-right + split-left
regression) · typography ✓ · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-06 — custom-form-donate: wire submit hand-off + NEW `split-even` section (quote beside form)
User asked (a) whether the inline donation form actually hands its payload off to the FundraiseUp hosted page
(`https://ustaf.donorsupport.co/page/CHRIS50?elementTitle=…&elementName=Chris%2050%20Donation%20Embed`) like the
source, and (b) for a sample section placing the source's supporter Quote beside the form (2 blocks side by side).

Finding: the source form is a third-party **FundraiseUp** iframe embed (campaign `AURLRFGR`, element "Chris 50
Donation Embed"); clicking Donate opens FundraiseUp's hosted checkout at that donorsupport.co URL. Our block was a
STATIC reproduction — submit did `preventDefault()` only, no hand-off. The donorsupport.co/CHRIS50 URL is
FundraiseUp-internal (not in the inline DOM); the exact query-param names FundraiseUp's hosted page consumes are
opaue, so we use readable params as a best-effort prefill.

Wiring (`blocks/custom-form-donate/custom-form-donate.js`): submit now builds the hand-off URL from a base
(authored row 5, or the CHRIS50 default `DEFAULT_DONATE_URL` that preserves the source's elementTitle/elementName)
and appends the collected payload — `amount` (from the custom-amount input / active tier), `frequency`
(`once|monthly` from the active toggle), and when Dedicate is checked `dedicate=true` + `honoreeName`. Preserves
any params already on the base. Opens the secure hosted page in a NEW TAB (`window.open(_blank, noopener`)) —
outward-facing action, matches the source opening its checkout. Extended the authoring contract with an optional
**row 5** = donation URL (link href or plain text). Verified the built URL:
`…/page/CHRIS50?elementTitle=Donation+Form&elementName=Chris+50+Donation+Embed&amount=50&frequency=once&dedicate=true&honoreeName=Jane+Doe`.

NEW section style `split-even` (`styles/styles.css`, after split-right): a SYMMETRIC, block-agnostic two-column
section for TWO blocks side by side. Unlike split-left/right (which key off default-content vs block), it just
flows each direct wrapper into its own equal column via `grid-auto-flow: column` + `grid-auto-columns: 1fr` in
source order (first→left, second→right) — no nth-child logic, works for any block pair. Same page content width
(720/970/1170), 30px gutter, from 768; mobile stacks (block layout). Two fixes needed: `min-width: 0` on the grid
items (a wide block's min-content was stealing >1fr → unequal columns) and a specificity-matched
`… > div[..-wrapper] + div[..-wrapper] { margin-top: 0 }` to cancel the global inter-wrapper spacing (which pushed
the 2nd block down out of row alignment). Sample:
`content/drafts/sections-samples/section-split-even-donate.plain.html` — source supporter Quote (Selah Stibbins)
left + custom-form-donate right, per the source screenshot. Verified @1280: equal 570px columns, same top, 30px
gap; @390 stacks quote→form (both 328). Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ · typography ✓ · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-06 — custom-form-donate: CORRECTED hand-off param keys (verified on live hosted page)
Follow-up: user wants the typed dedicate name (e.g. "Meet") to land in the hosted page's "Dedicate this
donation" field. My first-pass keys (`frequency`, `honoreeName`, `dedicate=true`) were GUESSES. Empirically
probed the live `ustaf.donorsupport.co/page/CHRIS50` widget with Playwright (read the field values after each
navigate, ~8s settle):
  - `amount=<dollars>`      → prefills the amount field ✓ CONFIRMED (tested 100/250)
  - `recurring=once|monthly`→ sets the frequency toggle ✓ CONFIRMED (my `frequency=` did NOTHING)
  - dedicate/tribute NAME   → tried ~15 keys (tribute, honoree, honoreeName, dedication, tributeName,
      tribute_name, honoree_name, dedicateName, dedicateTo, inHonorOf(Name), tributeText, tribute[name],
      donation[tribute], name, …) — NONE populated the field. FundraiseUp exposes no working URL param for it
      that we could find (its docs site was 522/down at check time). Bracket `donation[...]` scheme also did
      nothing.
Fix (`custom-form-donate.js`): submit now sets `amount` + `recurring` (confirmed keys) and passes the honoree as
`tribute=<name>` best-effort (harmless if ignored). Verified the block emits
`…/page/CHRIS50?…&amount=100&recurring=monthly&tribute=Meet`, and that URL on the live page prefills $100 +
Monthly (tribute still blank — hosted-page limitation, not ours). Gates: lint 0 errors.
NOTE: getting the dedicate name to truly prefill would require the FundraiseUp-supported param (needs their docs
or account owner) — flag for the client if that field must round-trip.

### 2026-09-06 — custom-form-donate: deep-dive on how the source carries the dedicate name (URL never changes)
User observed the redirect URL never includes the typed dedicate name — always the bare
`…/page/CHRIS50?elementTitle=…&elementName=…`. Deep-dived the live hosted page: instrumented fetch/XHR/
sendBeacon, dumped local+sessionStorage, set the tribute field via the native setter (React-registered input),
then clicked Donate. Findings: (1) the typed value is in NO network request, NO localStorage, NO sessionStorage
at input time — `netCount:0`, no storage hits; (2) the URL stays unchanged through checkout; (3) clicking Donate
opens the "Secure donation" checkout INSIDE THE SAME widget instance (no navigation), and the checkout's
"Dedicate this donation (optional)" field shows the typed value — proving it lives ONLY in the widget's
in-memory React state and survives because the same instance renders both screens. Conclusion: FundraiseUp does
not read the dedicate name from the URL at all; no query param (ours or theirs) can prefill it — the only way to
reproduce that round-trip is the real FundraiseUp embed. Removed the dead best-effort `tribute=` param; submit
now appends ONLY the confirmed keys `amount` + `recurring`. Generated URL verified:
`…/page/CHRIS50?…&amount=100&recurring=monthly`. Header comment documents the widget-internal data path. Gates:
lint 0 errors.

### 2026-09-06 — custom-form-donate: NEW `.embed` variant = the REAL FundraiseUp widget (dedicate name round-trips)
User: use the real embed so the "Dedicate this donation" honoree name carries to the checkout URL the same way
the amount does. Extracted the source's live install: loader `cdn.fundraiseup.com/widget/AURLRFGR` + an inline
element the widget upgrades from `<a href="#XJYDXZPC">` into `<iframe id="XJYDXZPC" title="Donation Form">`
(fluid, min 286 / max 376px, ~716px tall).
Added an `.embed` variant to the block (dispatch by class; the native reproduction stays the DEFAULT):
`decorateEmbed()` appends `<a class="cfd-embed-anchor" href="#<ELEMENT>">` and injects the loader script ONCE per
account (deduped by src). Authoring: row1 = account code (default AURLRFGR), row2 = element code (default
XJYDXZPC), row3 = fallback label. Codes are sanitized to `[A-Za-z0-9]` before use in the src/href (never inject
raw author text into a script tag). CSS: `.custom-form-donate.embed` centers, reserves 716px min-height to cut
layout shift, caps the iframe at 376px (source).
VERIFIED END-TO-END on localhost: the loader upgraded the anchor into the real widget iframe (same fields as
source). Typed "Meet" into Honoree full name → clicked Donate and Support → widget navigated to
`ustaf.donorsupport.co/page/CHRIS50?…` and the checkout's "Dedicate this donation" field showed **Meet** — the
name round-trips natively (amount also carried), exactly as the source does. This is the ONLY way to carry the
dedicate name (see prior entry: it's not a URL param — lives in widget state).
Sample: `content/drafts/sections-samples/section-split-even-donate-embed.plain.html` — Selah Stibbins quote left +
`.embed` form right in a `split-even` section. Desktop: equal 570px cols, same top, 30px gap, iframe capped 376px;
mobile stacks. Trade-off vs the native default: a third-party script + iframe (consent/perf) — so the native copy
remains the default; use `.embed` when the dedicate name must round-trip. Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓ ·
overflow ✓ · a11y ✓ (all @ the embed sample).

### 2026-09-06 — custom-form-donate: REVERTED the `.embed` (real FundraiseUp) variant — CSP blocks it two ways
Tried embedding the real FundraiseUp widget so the dedicate name would round-trip. Hit TWO hard CSP walls:
(1) In-page: the widget renders via `document.write(<raw string>)`, blocked by the site's
`require-trusted-types-for 'script'` in `head.html` (untouchable) → "This document requires 'TrustedHTML'
assignment." (2) Isolated in a same-origin host iframe (blocks/custom-form-donate/fundraiseup.html) to dodge the
Trusted Types policy — the form rendered AND captured the typed honoree ("Meet"), but at checkout FundraiseUp
tried to frame `ustaf.donorsupport.co`, which sends `frame-ancestors 'none'` → "refused to connect". Confirmed
against the source: there the widget is a DIRECT child of the top page, so Donate does a TOP-LEVEL navigation
(whole tab → donorsupport.co, name carried); our extra iframe nesting makes it navigate the host frame instead,
which is refused. Making it behave like the source would require running FundraiseUp's loader in-page, i.e.
adding a site-wide Trusted Types default policy in scripts.js — a global weakening of XSS protection. Per user
decision, NOT doing that. Removed: `decorateEmbed`/dispatcher + `.embed` CSS, deleted
`blocks/custom-form-donate/fundraiseup.html`; the embed draft sample is obsolete (content/ is gitignored, so it
never ships). The block is back to the single native reproduction: renders the form + hands off amount/recurring
to the hosted page on submit (dedicate name can't round-trip via URL — FundraiseUp platform limitation, see prior
entries). Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-06 — custom-form-donate: EXACT-parity re-measure (fixed 360px card, not full-width)
User: migrated form differs from source in positions/dimensions/paddings. Root cause found by measuring the live
FundraiseUp widget element-by-element (Playwright into the iframe): the source is a FIXED ~360px card (iframe 376,
card 360, 20px pad, 14px radius, 2px #dedfe3 border, 316px inner column) that renders identically at every
viewport — but our reproduction stretched to fill the column (700px in the block sample) with ~40%-oversized
fonts/controls. Rewrote `custom-form-donate.css` to the measured source spec: card max-width 360 (was 700), pad
20 (was 32/40), radius 14 (was 16), border 2px #dedfe3; freq pills 40px tall / 16px w600 (was 54 / 20); heading
16/24 (was 22); amount tiles 3-col gap 4, 40px tall, 16px, r6 (was 56 / 22 / r8); custom-amount row 48px, input
26px (was 72 / 40); dedicate checkbox 20px + label 14/20 (was 28 / 20); honoree field 52px, floating label 12px,
value 16/24, r6; tooltip pad 11/16, 14/20 (was 16/20, 18); designation 14/20; comment link 14; CTA 56px, 16
w600, r6 (was 72 / 22 / r8). Verified ours vs source at 1280 — every element within 1-3px (card 360/pad20/r14,
freq 40h, tile 103×40, honoree 316×52, tooltip pad 11/16, CTA 56h/16w600). Screenshot confirms visual match.
Fixed-width card ⇒ identical at all viewports (no per-breakpoint rules needed; dropped the old @768 padding bump).
Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ (360–1920) · a11y ✓ (block sample).
NOTE: the split-even section sample 404'd locally (dev-server proxy cached the miss before the draft indexed) —
transient, not a code issue; form parity verified on the block sample.

### 2026-09-06 — split-even donate sample: quote content now matches source (real testimonial, 1-line attribution)
The split-even sample showed placeholder quote text ("Chris Evert gave so much…") with a TWO-line attribution
(name / affiliation), not the source's real testimonial. Fixed the sample content
(`content/drafts/sections-samples/section-split-even-donate.plain.html`) to the source's actual quote: two
quoted paragraphs (opening/closing “ ” marks) + a SINGLE-line attribution `- Selah Stibbins, Howard University
'26` — identical to the served `quote` block sample. No code change: the `quote` block CSS was already
source-matched (32/48 italic quotation, 20px inset, 40px gap, centered bold-italic attribution) and the block
sample renders it correctly (verified: two quoted <p> + single attribution <p>; a11y ✓, overflow ✓).
GOTCHA (why the section sample looked wrong): the AEM CLI serves *previewed* drafts from the content-bus and only
proxies local CODE — draft `.plain.html` pages render ONLY if they've been previewed/pushed. `section-yellow` /
`block-samples/*` render because they're on the bus; `section-split-even-donate` 404s BOTH locally and on remote
preview because it was never previewed (confirmed via remote curl). So this sample can't render until the draft
is pushed to preview (outward-facing, on request). The quote-block correctness is proven on the served block
sample.

### 2026-09-06 — social: added `center` + `right` alignment variants (news-article share bar sits right)
On the news-article template the share bar (FB/Twitter/LinkedIn/copy/print) is RIGHT-aligned on desktop, but our
social block defaulted to LEFT (centered mobile). Added two block variants in `social.css`, desktop/tablet only
(inside the existing @768 block): `.social.center .social-bar { justify-content: center }` and `.social.right
.social-bar { justify-content: flex-end }`. Default (no variant) stays left. MOBILE behaviour unchanged — the base
rule centers the row for ALL variants below 768. No JS change (pure class-based). Verified computed
justify-content: @1280 default=flex-start, center=center, right=flex-end; @390 all three = center. Sample
`content/drafts/block-samples/social.plain.html` now shows all three (default/center/right) with h2 labels.

### 2026-09-06 — Typography parity pass: custom-form-donate + table.directory (all viewports)
Measured source typography element-by-element at 1280/768/390 (into the FundraiseUp iframe for the form; the
Board panel for the directory).

table.directory — the ONE gap was the section heading: source is RESPONSIVE 22/24.2 mobile → 28/30.8 @768
(Graphik Semibold w500 #000); ours was fixed 28/30.8. Added a mobile base (22/24.2) + @768 bump. Name entries
already correct (16/24 mobile → 18/24 @768 via --body-font-size-m, Graphik Regular #000). Verified @390/768/1280.

custom-form-donate — source is IBM Plex Sans (FundraiseUp's font) at a FIXED card, NO responsive font changes at
any viewport. We keep the site brand (Graphik) per prior direction but matched every NUMERIC value
(size/weight/line-height/color/alignment). Fixes: big amount value 26→**36/44** w400 blue; currency 20→**21/26**;
tooltip 14/20→**13/18** #2f2f30; add-comment added **lh 18**; honoree floating label kept 12/16 (source renders
16px then scale(0.75)=12 effective) with color → ink@80%. Already-correct (unchanged): freq pill 16 w600 blue,
heading 16/24 w400, amount tile 16 w400, USD 16/24, dedicate label 14/20, honoree input 16/24, designation 14/20,
CTA 16/24 w600 white. Re-measured: currency 21/26, value 36/44, label 12/16, tooltip 13/18, comment 14/18 — all
match. Card height stayed ~662 (no wrap/overflow regressions); screenshot confirms the big blue $50.

### 2026-09-06 — Removed unused `tabs` block + flagged 2 draft samples for deletion
Cleanup: the `tabs` block and its sample, plus the `columns-statement` sample, aren't needed. Confirmed the tabs
block is referenced NOWHERE in code (grep across scripts/styles/blocks, excluding the block itself and the
unrelated toc-profile). Deleted `blocks/tabs/` (tabs.js + tabs.css). The two draft sample pages live under
content/ (deletion blocked by the content-preservation safeguard, and content/ is gitignored so they never ship)
— handed to the user to delete manually: `content/drafts/block-samples/columns-statement.plain.html` and
`content/drafts/block-samples/tabs.plain.html`. Note: `columns-statement` was only a variant DEMO of the columns
block (no separate block dir), so nothing to remove in blocks/. Gates: lint 0 errors.

### 2026-09-06 — Breadcrumb: metadata + query-index driven (labels ≠ URL slug; /news/ skipped; ancestor links)
Discovered the source breadcrumb is NOT derived from the URL path: (1) labels are MANAGED titles (slug
`financials` → "Annual Reports and Financial Information"); (2) news articles COLLAPSE to "Home > {title}" (the
/news/ ancestor is hidden); (3) each ancestor crumb links to its real page (.html), current page is plain text
(verified all source targets 200). Our old `buildBreadcrumb()` in blocks/header/header.js derived crumbs from the
slug — wrong labels + would show a News crumb.
Rewrote it (per user decision "page metadata + query-index", "match source / skip news"): now async, fetches
`/query-index.json` (root, then /content fallback) ONCE into a path→title map (prefers row `breadcrumbtitle` →
`navtitle` → `title`); ancestor labels come from that map (slug de-hyphenation only as last-resort fallback);
current page label prefers its own `breadcrumb-title` metadata → document.title. `BREADCRUMB_HIDDEN_SEGMENTS =
{content, en, news}` are dropped from the trail (hrefs still accumulate correctly); `home` collapses to a single
"Home" crumb → /en/home.html. Because the query-index regenerates on every publish, a NEW page automatically gets
the correct crumb label on publish — no separate breadcrumb sheet to maintain; authors can override per page via a
`breadcrumb-title` (and we can add pages to BREADCRUMB_HIDDEN_SEGMENTS for other hidden sections).
Verified the segment logic against source-shaped paths: news → "Home > 2023 NJTL Essay Contest Winners" (news
skipped); financials → "Home > Who We Are > Annual Reports and Financial Information"; chris-evert → "Home > Get
Involved > Special Funds > {title}" — all matching source, ancestor links to real .html. Local drafts page falls
back to slug labels + document.title (no index locally) and renders correctly. Gates: lint 0 · a11y ✓ · overflow ✓.
AUTHORING NOTE for new pages: set the page Metadata `Title` (used as the breadcrumb label via the index); to show
a different crumb label than the browser title, add a `Breadcrumb Title` metadata field; the page's parent chain
comes from its URL folder path.

### 2026-09-06 — Added helix-query.yaml (query-index) — powers breadcrumb labels + news feed (image/title/desc/date)
Created `helix-query.yaml` at repo root defining TWO indices:
  • `default` → /query-index.json (one row per published page; excludes /drafts, nav, footer, fragments).
    Properties: title (og:title), breadcrumbtitle (meta breadcrumb-title override), description, image (og:image),
    publicationdate (meta publication-date), lastModified (from Last-Modified header), robots.
  • `news` → /news-index.json (scoped to /**/news/**) with title/description/image/publicationdate/lastModified —
    the feed the Related Articles cards can query dynamically (image + title + description + date per article).
The breadcrumb header (blocks/header/header.js) reads this: ancestor labels = row.breadcrumbtitle || row.title
(managed title, not URL slug); current page still prefers its own breadcrumb-title meta → document.title. Tidied
the map builder to the real field names (dropped the speculative navtitle).
IMPORTANT: the index is built by the AEM pipeline on PUBLISH — it does NOT exist on localhost (`/query-index.json`
404s locally, which is why breadcrumbs fall back to slug + document.title in local dev; they light up on
preview/prod once pages are published). YAML validated; lint 0.
AUTHORING model for a news article to appear correctly in the feed + breadcrumb:
  - Title (Metadata) → og:title → card title + breadcrumb label
  - Description (Metadata) → card description
  - Image → og:image (first image / set via metadata) → card image
  - Publication Date (Metadata `publication-date`) → card date (falls back to last-modified)
  - Breadcrumb Title (Metadata `breadcrumb-title`) → optional crumb-label override

### 2026-09-06 — [WIP] News TEMPLATE + importer + first page imported (offline-by-aerie)
Built the full news pipeline while user was away. Status by piece:
DONE:
  • Template mechanism: added loadTemplateCSS/loadTemplateJS to scripts.js — reads `template` metadata, loads
    templates/<name>/<name>.css eagerly (LCP) + <name>.js in lazy. Added `getMetadata` import. (No boilerplate
    template loader existed before.)
  • templates/news/news.css + news.js: article typography from SOURCE measurements — H1 Graphik XXCond Bold w500
    #333, 54/59.4 mobile → 100/110 @768; body 16/24 → 18/24 @768 #000; inline links #0357b8; caption 16/22.86 #333
    (via `p:has(>picture)+p`). JS is a no-op hook (layout is content+CSS driven). Scoped to `body.news`.
  • tools/importer/import-news-v1.js (+ .bundle.js): ONE importer for the news TEMPLATE. Reuses the cleanup
    transformer; converts the source's dynamic SOCIAL widget → `social (right)` block (matches tightest container
    holding the fb/li/copy/print labels, drops the checkmark/"Link Copied!" bits); converts the Related Articles
    <ul> → `cards (news)` block (image via data-src→src, date, desc, Read More; title via <h3> with an aria-label
    "Visit the <title> page" fallback). Metadata: Title/Description/Image auto (createMetadata) + Template=news
    (+ Publication Date when the runner passes one).
  • Imported the EG page → content/en/home/news/usta-foundation-offline-by-aerie-and-the-aerie-real-foundatio.
    Completeness 91.4%. Ran localize-assets.mjs → 5 images pulled to /media-da (hero + 4 card thumbs).
  • Structural check of the fragment: H1 ✓, body ¶ ✓, local inline image ✓, social-right ✓ (no raw share SVGs),
    cards-news 4 rows ✓, template=news ✓, title ✓. Lint 0 errors (added tools/importer/*.bundle.js to
    .eslintignore; bundles carry /* eslint-disable */).
BLOCKED / NOT DONE:
  • Pixel-parity pass (task #17): the AEM CLI renders only PREVIEWED content at the real route — a brand-new local
    page under a published path (/en/home/news/…) is shadowed by the remote proxy and 404s at the rendered URL
    (serves only as /content/…​.plain.html). So the page can't render locally to measure. Needs a preview
    (outward-facing, on request) before the parity measurement + tuning can run. Template CSS is seeded from source
    numbers but NOT yet verified against our render.
  • cards-news card TITLE (<h3>) came through empty on some runs — the Related Articles feed is a flaky JS-hydrated
    Vue widget (guide §2 warns about this); the aria-label fallback helps but isn't 100%. Since this feed is
    DYNAMIC and will be wired from /news-index.json later (helix-query.yaml already defines it + user said "wire
    later"), scraping specific cards is a stopgap — the block placeholder is what matters.
NEXT (when back / on preview enabled): preview the page → pixel-parity at 390/768/1280 → tune templates/news/news.css
→ run overflow/typography/a11y → then import the remaining news URLs through the same script.

### 2026-09-07 — News page parity fixes (from preview screenshots): cards 4-up, media-right image, breadcrumb
Page is now on preview; user flagged 3 diffs vs source. Fixed all three, driven by SOURCE measurements:
1. cards-news column count — source Related Articles is 4-UP desktop (card 293 in 1170), 3-UP tablet (227), 1-UP
   mobile (328). Ours was 3-up desktop. blocks/cards/cards.css: @768 → flex 33.333% (3-up); @992 → flex 25% /
   max-width 25% (4-up). Verified LIVE on the cards-news sample: 328 @390 (1-up), 240 @768 (3-up), 293/243 @992
   (4-up). Overflow ✓ a11y ✓.
2. Article body image → columns media-right. Source lays the merch image text-left / image-right on desktop
   (image left=655 w=570 in the right half; text 3 paragraphs left), stacking on tablet/mobile — a columns media
   block, NOT inline default content. importer `wrapMediaColumns()`: finds the body image (bare <img> or in <p>,
   excludes related-card thumbs), takes the 3 nearest preceding body paragraphs as the left cell, image + caption
   (from same wrapper, else next <p>, wrapped in <em>) as the right cell, emits `Columns (media-right)`.
   Verified in the imported .plain.html: 1 columns media-right block, image + <em> caption in right cell, text in
   left cell, no duplicated copy. Re-localized images (5, 0 leftover hotlinks).
3. Breadcrumb width/height. blocks/header/header.css @992: constrained the crumb <ol> to the CONTENT column
   (max-width 1170, was 1440) so crumbs align to the H1 gutter; added flex-wrap:nowrap + last-crumb
   ellipsis (overflow hidden / text-overflow ellipsis / white-space nowrap / min-width 0) so a long article-title
   crumb stays ONE line and the row never grows taller.
Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ · a11y ✓ (cards-news sample; header CSS is global). NOTE: the imported
news page itself renders only on the auth'd preview (preview-aemcoder.adobe.io) — couldn't re-measure it live
here; fixes are from source numbers + verified on the served cards-news sample. Re-import/preview to confirm the
columns-media + breadcrumb on the actual article.

### 2026-09-07 — Breadcrumb alignment fix (crumbs now land on the content column)
User: migrated breadcrumb "HOME" sat far left (near viewport edge) instead of aligned with the H1/content like the
source. Root cause: the crumb <ol> used its own width scheme (1440→1170 + 40px padding) that never matched the
page content column. Fix (blocks/header/header.css): the <ol> now mirrors `main > .section > div` EXACTLY — width
100%, margin-inline auto, zero padding, tiered max-width 328 → 720 @768 → 970 @992 → 1170 @1200. Removed the old
@992 override (was 1170 + 40px padding); kept only flex-wrap:nowrap + last-crumb ellipsis there. Verified LIVE
(crumb left edge vs source): @1280 = 55px (matches source H1 @55), @1440 = 135px (centered 1170), @768 = 24px,
@390 = 31px. Row height steady ~59px. The full-width top/bottom border still runs edge-to-edge (on .nav-breadcrumb,
not the ol). Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓ · overflow ✓ · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-07 — Breadcrumb alignment CORRECTED (align to LOGO, not content column)
My prior entry aligned the crumb <ol> to the narrow content column (970/1170) — WRONG: that pushed "HOME" too far
RIGHT (crumb-left 55 @1280, 135 @1440) while the source sits under the LOGO. Source dev tools confirm: breadcrumb
lives in the site's 1440 container with ~38px padding-left = logo gutter. Reverted the content-column tiers;
restored the crumb <ol> to max-width 1440 + padding 0 40px (same as the nav/logo container). Verified LIVE: crumb-
left == logo-left = 40px @1280 AND @1440 (exact match). Kept flex-wrap:nowrap + last-crumb ellipsis. Header/logo
untouched. Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓ · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-07 — Breadcrumb desktop HEIGHT fix (30px, was 40px) — removes content shift
User: header shift vs source + breadcrumb div taller on migrated. Measured both in dev tools at desktop: nav is
128px on BOTH (already correct — the perceived shift was the taller breadcrumb pushing content down). Source
breadcrumb row = 30px; ours was 40px (crumb line-height 38 + 2×1px border). Added @992 rule dropping the crumb
line-height 38 → 28px, so the row = 28 + 2px borders = 30px, matching source. Verified LIVE @1728: navH 128,
bcH 30. Article content below now starts at the same Y as the source (shift gone). Header/logo untouched. Gates:
lint 0 · breakpoints ✓ · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-07 — News H1 top gap (breadcrumb → H1) matched to source
Measured source gap breadcrumb-bottom → H1-top: 108px desktop/tablet (≥768), 76px mobile. Driven by the source's
first content section `padding-top: 64px` (32px mobile) + the H1 line-box leading. Ours had no equivalent top
padding on the news article's first section, so the H1 sat too close to the breadcrumb. Added to
templates/news/news.css (scoped body.news): `main > .section:first-of-type { padding-top: 32px }` + `@768 → 64px`.
With our matching 100/110 (54/59.4 mobile) H1 scale this reproduces the source gap. Scoped to news pages only;
verify on preview (can't render the news template on the local cards-news sample — no body.news there). Gates:
lint 0 · breakpoints ✓.

### 2026-09-07 — News page: 6 parity fixes from source-vs-migrated compare
1. Top blue accent bar: source is 8px (measured), ours was 5px → header.css border-top 5→8px.
2. H1 color: source #333 (NOT jet black); global `main .default-content-wrapper :is(h1..){color:var(--dark-color)}`
   (jet black) was overriding our news h1. Fixed news.css to also target `.default-content-wrapper h1` so #333 wins.
3. columns media-right text: source pairs the merch image with "This grant…"/"To celebrate…" (level with it), NOT
   the earlier "Central…" (full-width above). importer wrapMediaColumns now takes the image's PREVIOUS sibling
   group (fallback: 2 nearest preceding paragraphs) → block now starts "This grant…". Verified.
4. Breadcrumb "Home" is a clickable link → /en/home.html (already in header.js buildBreadcrumb; the stale screenshot
   predated that; confirmed in code).
5. Related Articles missing card titles: hydration left <h3> empty; strengthened importer fallback to also read the
   image alt "Visit the <title> page" → all 4 titles now populate (WHM 2026 / USTAF partners / USTA Foundation
   pledges / Black History Month). Verified h3 count 4.
6. Stray "Title / Template / news" text at page bottom: the Metadata block was a bare top-level `<div class=
   metadata>` (renders visibly). Added `main.appendChild(<hr>)` before createMetadata (like the home importer) so
   metadata lands in its OWN section → serializes as `<div><div class="metadata">` which EDS strips. Verified.
Re-import completeness 94.7%; images re-localized (5, 0 hotlinks). Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓ · top-bar 8px
verified live. Header/logo otherwise untouched. News template CSS (#2) verifies on preview (needs body.news).

### 2026-09-07 — News H1 color hardened to #333 (was inheriting jet-black)
Confirmed source H1 computes to rgb(51,51,51)=#333 (inherits body #333; H1 color:inherit/unset in source CSS).
Our global `main .default-content-wrapper :is(h1..){color:var(--dark-color=#000)}` was painting it black. news.css
now (a) sets an explicit #333 on `body.news main h1`, (b) a higher-specificity twin
`body.news main .default-content-wrapper h1{color:#333}` (0,2,3 beats the global 0,1,2), AND (c) re-points
--dark-color:#333 on the H1 so it resolves to #333 even if the global rule wins. Belt-and-suspenders — guaranteed
#333. (Couldn't render a body.news page locally to eyeball; verified by specificity + source value. The earlier
"still black" screenshot was the pre-fix preview.) Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓.

### 2026-09-07 — Fixed large CLS (0.47) on news page — H1 display-font swap
PageSpeed flagged heavy layout shift on load. Measured live CLS = 0.4694; dominant shift 0.317 = the H1. Root
cause: the H1 (Graphik XXCond Bold, up to 100px, the LCP headline) renders in a fallback first, then swaps →
measured the wrapping H1 at 416px with the real font vs 772px with the Arial fallback = a ~356px page jump.
Graphik XXCond is ULTRA-condensed: canvas-measured at 50.6% of Arial's advance width (the old
`roboto-condensed-fallback` at 88.82% was tuned for a different font, so it under-corrected badly).
Two fixes:
1. PRELOAD the display woff2 (24KB) in loadEager → `preloadDisplayFont()` injects <link rel=preload as=font> so
   the real font is available ~first paint and the H1 paints in final metrics (primary fix; no swap → no shift).
2. Metrics-matched fallback face `graphik-xxcond-fallback` (styles.css): size-adjust 50.6% + ascent-override 141%
   / descent-override 42% / line-gap 0 (Graphik metrics ÷ 0.506), wired into --heading-font-family before Arial
   Narrow — so even pre-preload the fallback box ≈ the real font (safety net).
Font file verified reachable (served woff2). NOTE: the sandbox headless browser can't load local() fonts, so the
final CLS number must be re-checked on PageSpeed after deploy — the diagnosis (356px H1 jump) and both fixes are
sound. Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓.

### 2026-09-07 — News H1: inherit GLOBAL size, manage only color per-template
Per direction: H1 SIZE should be identical site-wide (so the font-preload/fallback CLS fix applies uniformly);
only COLOR varies by template. Verified the source H1 color is genuinely contextual — news #333, section-landing
(leadership) #000, hero #fff — so color stays per-template, NOT global. The global h1 already computes to the
exact news size (54/100px @ line-height 1.1 = 59.4/110), so news.css no longer redeclares font-size/line-height/
family — it inherits the global scale. news.css now only sets the news-specific color (#333, via explicit rule +
--dark-color re-point to beat the global prose-black rule) and the source margin (0 0 10px). Global h1 unchanged
(stays the shared size for all templates). Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓.

### 2026-09-07 — Mobile breadcrumb (single-line scroll) + mobile LCP (unblock template CSS)
DESKTOP PageSpeed now 99, CLS 0 (font-preload + metrics fallback worked). Two mobile fixes:
1. Breadcrumb wrapped into a tall multi-line block on mobile (the long article-title crumb). Source keeps it ONE
   line that scrolls horizontally. header.css base `ol`: flex-wrap:wrap → nowrap + overflow-x:auto + hidden
   scrollbar (WebKit/FF); `li { flex:0 0 auto; white-space:nowrap }`. Desktop tier overrides: overflow-x:hidden +
   `li:last-child { flex:0 1 auto; text-overflow:ellipsis }` (has room, no scroll). Verified @390: bc height 40px,
   nowrap, overflow-x auto, no page-level horizontal overflow.
2. Mobile LCP 5.1s / H1 element-render-delay 2270ms. `loadTemplateCSS()` was AWAITED in loadEager, adding a full
   CSS round-trip before the H1 could render. Since the LCP H1's SIZE now lives in global styles.css (news template
   only sets color/spacing, not LCP-critical), made template CSS load NON-BLOCKING: fire the promise, render eager,
   await it only for loadLazy's templateName. Font already preloaded (prev fix). Gates: lint 0 · overflow ✓ · a11y ✓.
NOTE: mobile LCP/FCP re-verify on PageSpeed after deploy. Remaining audit items (efficient cache lifetimes, minify
CSS/JS, network dependency tree) are largely platform/EDS-pipeline controlled, not app CSS/JS.

### 2026-09-07 — Mobile breadcrumb: keep the scrollbar VISIBLE (match source)
Follow-up: source shows a working, draggable horizontal scrollbar on the breadcrumb; I'd hidden it. Removed the
scrollbar-hiding (scrollbar-width:none + ::-webkit-scrollbar{display:none}) from header.css so the native
horizontal scrollbar shows and moves, exactly like the source. Kept flex-wrap:nowrap + overflow-x:auto. Verified
@390 with a long title: ol scrollable (scrollWidth 844 > client 390), row stays 40px, no page overflow. Desktop
unchanged (overflow-x:hidden + ellipsis, fits without scroll). Gates: lint 0 · overflow ✓ · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-07 — Fix visible H1 font FLASH on mobile (font-display: optional + eager @font-face)
User saw the H1 render in one size then flip to another on load (FOUT). Root cause verified: the fallback H1 box
(772px) is ~356px taller than the real Graphik XXCond Bold (416px) — and this headless Chromium IGNORES
`size-adjust` (plain Arial, size-adjust 30/50%, Arial Narrow all measured 772px), so the metrics-matched fallback
can't be relied on to hide the swap. Switched the display face to `font-display: optional` (fonts.css): the browser
gives the web font a ~100ms window then LOCKS the choice for the pageview — it never swaps mid-render, so no size
flip. To make `optional` actually pick the real font on mobile (where fonts.css loads lazily), preloadDisplayFont()
now ALSO injects the `@font-face` inline in the eager phase (was preload-only), so the face is known + fetched
within the window on every viewport → H1 paints in Graphik XXCond from the start. H1 SIZE is uniform site-wide
(54/100px @ lh 1.1) — news inherits the global h1 (verified our news mobile H1 = 54/59.4, matching source).
Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓ · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-07 — H1 font: optional → block (headline must ALWAYS be the condensed font)
`font-display: optional` (prev fix) mis-fired: on mobile the ~100ms window lapsed, so it LOCKED the wide fallback
for the whole pageview → the H1 showed the non-condensed font and never corrected (user screenshot). Switched the
display face to `font-display: block` in BOTH places (styles/fonts.css + the eager inline @font-face in
scripts.js): the browser briefly renders the headline invisible until the font is ready, then paints the REAL
Graphik XXCond Bold — it never uses the wide fallback and never gets stuck on it. The block period is tiny because
we preload the 24KB woff2 AND inline-declare the face in the eager phase, so it's ready almost immediately on every
viewport. Net: H1 is ALWAYS the condensed font (the desired one), same size site-wide (54/100px). Gates: lint 0.

### 2026-09-07 — News importer: extract Description, Image, Publication Date into Metadata
The imported article's Metadata block previously held only Title + Template. The source is classic AEM with
JS-injected head meta, so `WebImporter.rules.createMetadata` recovered only Title (no og:description / og:image /
publish date in the static DOM). Enhanced `tools/importer/import-news-v1.js` to derive the missing fields so the
query-index (`helix-query.yaml`: title/description/image/publicationdate) gets real values:
  • **Description** — first substantial body paragraph (article lede), captured from the ORIGINAL DOM before any
    mutation, whitespace-collapsed.
  • **Image** — the article's hero/body `<img>` (excludes related-cards + share icons); added as a Metadata row
    BEFORE `adjustImageUrls` so its URL is normalized/localized identically to body images. After
    localize-assets it points at `/media-da/…` like the rest.
  • **Publication Date** — NOT on the article page or its head; the ONLY authoritative source is the site
    `/sitemap.xml` `<lastmod>` per URL. Resolved in a new `onLoad` hook (same-origin fetch, awaited by the runner),
    matched by pathname, formatted `Month DD, YYYY` (e.g. Aerie → "August 20, 2026", matching the story +
    image filename 20260820-aerie). `params.publicationDate` still overrides; blank → query-index lastModified
    fallback. Helpers: formatIsoDate(), normPath(), MONTH_NAMES.
`addMetaRow` now accepts a string OR a DOM node (for the Image <picture>) and skips a key createMetadata already
emitted (hasRow guard). Re-bundled (esbuild IIFE → import-news-v1.bundle.js, re-prepended `/* eslint-disable */`),
re-imported the EG page (completeness 95.8%), localized assets (5 imgs, incl. metadata hero → /media-da/).
Verified Metadata block now = Title / Description / Image(/media-da) / Template=news / Publication Date. Gates:
lint 0 errors.

### 2026-09-07 — Breadcrumb "Home" (and all ancestor crumbs) not clickable → drop the `.html`
User reported clicking the breadcrumb "Home" didn't go to the homepage. Root cause: the crumb linked to
`/en/home.html`, but EDS serves the EXTENSIONLESS route — verified on preview: `/en/home` → 200, `/en/home.html`
→ 404 (so the link resolved to a 404, i.e. effectively dead). The logo + footer already use `/en/home`. Fixed in
blocks/header/header.js: the hardcoded Home crumb now `href="/en/home"`, and the ancestor-crumb builder uses
`a.href = href` (was `${href}.html`). titleMap lookups are unaffected — its keys are already `.html`-stripped, so
`titleMap.get(href)` still matches. Gate: lint 0 errors.

### 2026-09-07 — Breadcrumb link crumb: match source (blue + default underline, hover removes underline)
User: the "Home" crumb should look like the source's link — blue with an underline, and the underline goes away on
hover. Our crumbs were grey (#383838) with NO default underline and underline-on-hover (inverted). Confirmed the
source rule `.cmp-breadcrumb__navigation-item--inactive` = color #0357b8 + text-decoration: underline, and its
`a:hover` = text-decoration: none. Fixed blocks/header/header.css: split the anchor out of the shared `li, a` rule
— `.nav-breadcrumb a { color:#0357b8; text-decoration:underline }` and `a:hover { text-decoration:none }`. The
current-page crumb is a plain <li> (no anchor) so it stays grey. Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓.

### 2026-09-07 — Breadcrumb separator: `>` chevron (green), not `/`
User: the crumb separator is a `>`, not a slash. Source `.cmp-breadcrumb__navigation-item-divider` = content `>`,
color #01675a (brand green), padding-left 6px / padding-right 8px. Updated the `li + li::before` in
blocks/header/header.css: content `>`, color #01675a, padding 0 8px 0 6px (was `/`, #383838, margin-right 4px).
Gate: lint 0 errors.

### 2026-09-07 — Desktop dropdown panel height: keep it TALL like the source
First attempt shrank the panel (link padding-bottom 15px → 6px, advance 54px → 45px) — WRONG direction: the source
panel is the TALLER one, so the migrated panel should match that airy height, not be tightened. Reverted: sub-item
link `padding: 0 0 15px` + li `margin-bottom: 15px` restored, giving the generous open panel that matches the
source's GET INVOLVED → Special Funds / NJTL Chapter Portal dropdown. Dashed 1px #e6e6e6 divider between items,
panel padding 12/20/36/26. Gate: lint 0 errors.

### 2026-09-07 — Desktop dropdown panel POSITION + width to match source exactly
User: the migrated dropdown differs from the source in position/dimensions — the panel should drop to the nav
bottom (first item at the breadcrumb row) and align text under the label. Measured source (GET INVOLVED @1280):
panel left 891 / right 1137 / width 246 (border-box), top 128 = nav bottom (crumb row), text @917 under the label,
margin-left -26px, padding 12/20/36/26. Ours was: panel top 84 (floated above the crumb, anchored to the short
label), left 917 + width 270 (content-box) so text indented to 941 and panel too wide. Fixes in
blocks/header/header.css:
  • top-level li: `position: relative; align-self: stretch` so the li fills the nav-row height and the panel's
    `top:100%` lands at the nav BOTTOM (breadcrumb row), not the label bottom.
  • panel: `box-sizing: border-box; width: 246px; min-width: 0; margin: 0 0 0 -26px` (was min-width 246
    content-box + no negative margin). Now text aligns under the label.
Verified live (injected): panel left 891 / right 1137 / width 246, item text @917, panel top ≈ crumb top — all
match the source. Gate: lint 0 errors.

### 2026-09-07 — Nav hover underline on ALL top-level items + typography parity check
(1) HOVER UNDERLINE: source applies a 4px blue underline (border-bottom: 4px solid rgb(36 86 178)) + blue text to
EVERY top-level nav item on hover — including non-megamenu items like WHAT WE DO / OUR IMPACT. Ours only showed it
on the OPEN (aria-expanded) megamenu item; plain :hover had blue text but no underline. Fixed blocks/header/header.css:
added `display:inline-block; box-shadow: inset 0 -4px 0 rgb(36 86 178)` to the `li:hover > a` rule (reusing the
inset-shadow technique from the expanded rule so the underline adds no row height / no layout shift). Verified live
(injected): hover box-shadow = inset 0 -4px 0 #2456b2, blue text, link box unchanged (612–716, bottom 84).
(2) TYPOGRAPHY PARITY: measured source vs migrated top-level nav labels at desktop — IDENTICAL: Graphik Semibold,
16px, weight 400, line-height 24px, letter-spacing normal, color #000, text-transform none. No change needed. (Nav
collapses to hamburger below 992 on both, so only the desktop tier renders these labels.) Gate: lint 0 errors.

### 2026-09-07 — News importer generalized for extra components (page-by-page bulk prep)
Extended tools/importer/import-news-v1.js beyond the Aerie baseline to cover the components found across the 71
remaining news pages. Key deterministic insight: the importer sees the LIVE (post-JS) DOM, and social/reactions
labels are JS-injected — so match on the source's STATIC component classes instead:
  • SOCIAL share bar = `div.socialmediasharing`; alignment is data-driven from its modifier class — `position-right`
    → `Social (right)` (newer layout, e.g. Aerie); plain → `Social (left)` (older layout, beside reactions). This
    replaces the old fragile aria-label matcher.
  • REACTIONS = `div.reactions` (older articles only) → `Custom Widget Reactions` block (title + prompt rows).
  • TWEETS = `blockquote.twitter-tweet` (Twitter's widget stays a blockquote) → `Quote (tweet)` (row1 body <p>s,
    row2 the trailing "— Name (@handle) Date" footer run).
  • INSTAGRAM = embed.js UPGRADES the blockquote to `iframe[src*="instagram.com/p/{id}/embed"]` BEFORE import, so we
    match BOTH the blockquote AND the iframe, recover the /p/{id}/ permalink, and emit a single-cell `Embed
    Instagram` block. wrapEmbeds() runs first so reading order (para→img→tweet→para→IG→para→IG) is preserved.
Page 1 VERIFIED — ngounoue-excellence-team-junior-french-open (91.9%): columns media-right → quote(tweet) → 2×
embed-instagram → social(left) → reactions → cards(news) → metadata; both IG permalinks recovered; assets localized
(3 imgs, 0 hotlinks).
PUBLICATION DATE — DECIDED: use the sitemap <lastmod>. The original publish dates were lost when the source was
republished — every date the LIVE source exposes (sitemap, and the Related-Articles cards, which are driven by the
SAME lastmod field) is the 2026 republish timestamp; the article head/body carry no real date. Verified: the same
article shows one identical lastmod date across every feed that references it (e.g. 2023-njtl-essay = "May 06,
2026" everywhere). So using sitemap <lastmod> reproduces EXACTLY what the live source shows its own users today —
the truest lift-and-shift. Already wired (resolvedPublicationDate in onLoad); no code change. No better date source
exists on the site.

### 2026-09-07 — News importer: pages 2–5 components (table / video-split / multi-media / layout-table flatten)
Continued generalizing import-news-v1.js one representative page at a time; all verified + assets localized:
  • PAGE 2 (2023-njtl-essay, 93.9%): `wrapDataTables()` — source authors a data grid as TWO adjacent col-6 `.text`
    columns each led by a bold header (Winners | NJTL Chapter), NOT an HTML <table>. Detect the adjacent bold-header
    col-6 pair (a full-width intro col-12 may precede) → `Table` block (header row + two body cells). Replace only
    the two data cols; intro stays default content.
  • PAGE 3 (community-impact-hub, 95.8%): `wrapVideoSections()` — a text col-6 + video col-6 (`.cmp-embed`, YouTube
    data-src) pair → `Video Embed` block inside a `split-right` SECTION (text default content + video-embed +
    Section Metadata style=split-right, fenced by <hr>). No share bar on this page (correct).
  • PAGE 4 (laver-cup, 95.4%): the "12 tables" are NESTED single-column LAYOUT tables wrapping body prose (email/CMS
    artifact), not data. Added a leftover-layout-`<table>` FLATTENER (deepest-first unwrap into cell contents) so no
    stray bordered tables ship. Result: clean prose + columns-media + social-left + reactions + cards.
  • PAGE 5 (njtl-ace-jabeiro-brown, 97.4%): rewrote `wrapMediaColumns()` to wrap EVERY body image (was single,
    hardcoded media-right). Each image pairs with its sibling col-6 text column; SIDE (media-left/right) read from
    the image's rendered left vs viewport centre — reproduces the source's alternating right→left→right. Excludes
    imgs inside `.socialmediasharing`/`.reactions` and empty-alt icons (fixes the reactions checkmark being wrapped
    as a 4th media block that ate the social bar).
BUGFIX (affects all pages): the page-metadata row injector matched the FIRST table whose first cell ~ /metadata/i,
which also matched "Section Metadata" (the split-right video section) → page Description/Image/Template/PubDate
landed in the wrong block. Tightened to exact /^metadata$/i.
All 5 gated: lint 0 errors; each localized (0 hotlinks). Importer now covers the full component set found across the
fleet (tweets, IG embeds, video split-right, data tables, layout-table flatten, multi/alternating media, social
left/right auto, reactions). Ready to bulk-run the remaining ~66.

### 2026-09-07 — News layout feedback: global block spacing, reactions centering, cards fill-width, Laver columns pairing
Four fixes from director review of the laver-cup page:
1. GLOBAL SPACING (styles.css): the inter-wrapper gap rule only spaced a wrapper FOLLOWING a block — so default
   content sitting directly ABOVE a block (e.g. body text → social bar) had no gap and abutted it. Broadened the
   rule to also space a BLOCK wrapper that follows a `.default-content-wrapper` (text → block), keeping the tight
   heading-lead-in exception. 32px mobile / 40px ≥768, both directions now. (Reordered selectors low→high specificity
   to satisfy stylelint no-descending-specificity.)
2. REACTIONS CENTERED (custom-widget-reactions.css): re-measured the source — the whole widget (title + emoji row +
   prompt) is CENTERED on the content midline (title centre = 640 = container centre at 1280, on both essay & laver
   pages). Was left-aligned per a stale earlier note. Changed align-items/text-align → center.
3. CARDS FILL WIDTH (cards.css): cards-news used fixed flex 25% (desktop) / 33.3% (tablet), so a 3-card feed left an
   empty 4th slot. Switched to `flex: 1 1 0` with max-width 33.333% (both tiers) so the row always fills the full
   content width — 3 cards → 3-up full-width, 4 → 4-up. No empty slot.
4. LAVER COLUMNS PAIRING (import-news-v1.js): the media block grabbed the wrong (intro) paragraph because the
   beside-text lived in a nested layout table that the flatten step unwrapped BEFORE wrapMediaColumns measured it.
   Fixes: (a) split the layout-table flatten into flattenLayoutTables() and run it AFTER wrapMediaColumns; (b) added
   GEOMETRIC pairing — pair the image with the paragraph(s) that render BESIDE it (vertical overlap + opposite side)
   as the primary strategy, robust to layout-table wrapping; (c) guarded flattenLayoutTables so it never unwraps our
   OWN block tables (was eating the columns-media table). Re-imported laver (95.4%, correct "Located in…/Mayor…"
   beside-text) + jabeiro (97.4%, 3 alternating media preserved). Gates: lint 0 errors, breakpoints ✓.

### 2026-09-07 — Ngounoue feedback: intro para in media cell, cards heading-span titles, IG centering
Director review of ngounoue-excellence-team-junior-french-open:
1. INTRO PARAGRAPH — the lead-in "The USTA Foundation Excellence Team once had representation…" sits in the LEFT
   column above the two beside-image paragraphs (source: all three at left 55–625, intro top aligned with the image
   top). wrapMediaColumns' geometric pairing missed it (its top was just ABOVE the image band). Made geometric
   beside-pairing the PRIMARY strategy (was secondary to the DOM-sibling col lookup) and widened the vertical
   window to include a paragraph starting up to ~110px above the image top (the col-12 lead-in) while still
   excluding a full row above. Now all 3 left paragraphs land in the media block's text cell.
2. TWEET — already a Quote (tweet) block; confirmed (body + "— Name (@handle) Date" footer). No change.
3. RELATED CARD 3 MISSING TITLE — the source renders a card title as `<span role="heading" aria-level="3">` inside
   `a.list-core-component__title` (NOT an <h3>), and that card had no thumbnail. buildRelatedBlock only matched
   h2/h3/h4 → empty title. Extended the title selector to also match `[role="heading"]` and
   `.list-core-component__title`. All 3 cards now titled (incl. "2023 NJTL Essay Contest Winners").
4. INSTAGRAM CENTERING (embed-instagram.css) — a standalone embed (single cell, no text column) was sitting in the
   left col-5 leaving the right half empty. Added a `:not(:has(.embed-instagram-text))` rule: from 768, a text-less
   embed spans full width and centres (display:block + margin:auto). Renders on preview.
Re-imported (92.5%), localized (0 hotlinks). Gates: lint 0 errors.

### 2026-09-07 — Table block: multi-row grouping + 3rd-card title (2023-njtl-essay)
1. TABLE ROWS: the winners table was one dense row. The source's blank `&nbsp;` group separators are STRIPPED from
   the DOM before import (confirmed via a debug log: groupsOf saw 1 group at import time though the live page has 5),
   so wrapDataTables now reconstructs sub-groups from CONTENT: split the LEFT column at each group-header paragraph
   (short label matching "…and Under/over", "division", "boys/girls", "Ns"), then chunk the RIGHT column into the
   same number of groups (it has no headers; source aligns items 1:1 per bracket) and emit ONE TABLE ROW per group
   pair. Verified 5 rows, correctly paired (10U→Legacy/Innercity … 18U→MH/Tennis Success). NOTE: DA block tables DO
   support multiple rows through html2md→md2da — an earlier "rows collapse" claim was a bad regex, not real.
2. 3RD CARD TITLE: same heading-span fix as ngounoue/jabeiro — re-import picked it up. All 3 related cards titled.
Gates: lint 0 errors; localized (0 hotlinks).

### 2026-09-07 — Table block: row gaps between groups (both columns, mobile + desktop)
The multi-row winners table had no gap between the age-bracket rows once stacked (mobile) — the CSS only spaced
`td + td`, not rows. Added row spacing in blocks/table/table.css: mobile `.table tbody tr + tr { margin-top: 24px }`
(stacked rows); desktop (≥768, real table rows where margin is ignored) `.table tbody tr + tr td { padding-top:
24px }`. Now each bracket group is separated in BOTH the Winners and NJTL Chapter columns, matching the source's
blank-line rhythm. CSS-only (renders on preview); applies to any multi-row table. Gates: lint 0 errors, breakpoints ✓.

### 2026-09-07 — Table block: column-major mobile stacking (grouped data tables)
Mobile view was WRONG — a multi-row <table> stacks its cells row-by-row, so the winners table interleaved
bracket→chapters→bracket→chapters. The source stacks COLUMN-MAJOR: the whole Winners column (header + bracket
groups, gaps between) then the whole NJTL Chapter column. Reworked blocks/table/table.js: a grouped data table
(>1 body row, all 2-cell) is now rebuilt column-major into `.table-grouped > .table-col > (.table-col-head |
.table-group)` instead of a <table>; a plain single-body-row table stays a semantic <table>. New CSS
`.table-grouped`: mobile 1-col grid (stacks col1 fully then col2, 24px gaps between groups via flex gap), desktop
(≥768) 2-col grid side by side on the shared grid gutter. Importer output unchanged (header + N group rows); the
regrouping is client-side. JS+CSS only (renders on preview); applies to any grouped 2-col data table. Gates: lint 0.

### 2026-09-07 — BULK IMPORT: remaining 66 news pages
Ran the finalized import-news-v1 over all remaining news articles (72 total − 6 samples = 66). Result: 66/66
success, 0 failures. All 72 news pages now in content/en/home/news. Completeness: 35 pages ≥95%, 30 at 90–95%, 1 at
85–90%, none <85%. Assets localized for all 66 (0 image hotlinks across the whole set; 72 media-da/ folders).
Block coverage across the fleet: social 66, reactions 62, columns-media 70, cards-news 72, table 1, quote-tweet 8,
embed-instagram 3, video-embed 3, metadata 72/72 (Title/Description/Image/Template/Publication Date). Pages without
social (6) / columns (2) verified legitimate (source has no share bar / no body image — essay-winners use the table
instead), not failed imports. Gates: lint 0 errors.

### 2026-09-07 — Tweet handling: dedupe hidden duplicates + split-left tweet section
carol-ngounoue-runner-up-wimbledon-event showed the tweet TWICE and full-width instead of the source's
tweet-left/text-right layout. Two fixes in import-news-v1.js:
1. DEDUPE — the source ships the pre-hydration `blockquote.twitter-tweet` TWICE (one visible, one collapsed
   width=0/height=0). Added isHiddenDup() (zero rendered size) and drop those in both wrapEmbeds and the new
   wrapTweetSections, so only the visible tweet becomes a quote block.
2. SPLIT-LEFT SECTION — when a tweet sits in a partial-width grid column (col-5/6/7) BESIDE a text column, wrap it
   as a `split-left` SECTION (quote(tweet) left + article text as default content right + Section Metadata
   style=split-left, <hr>-fenced), matching section-split-left-tweet sample. Broadened from col-6 to col-5/6/7 after
   finding chris-evert-espn uses col-5/col-7. A full-width (col-12) tweet with no beside-text stays an inline
   quote block (correct — verified 5 such pages).
Re-imported all 8 tweet pages: each now 1 tweet; 3 got split-left (carol, chris-espn, clervie-first), 5 stay inline
(source full-width). page metadata intact (5 keys, section-metadata not absorbed), 0 hotlinks. Gates: lint 0 errors.

### 2026-09-08 — News H1: breadcrumb→H1 gap matched to source default (was 64px, too tall)
The template forced `padding-top: 64px` on the first section, pushing every news H1 far below the breadcrumb. But
the source gap is AUTHOR-controlled per article, not a template rule: the DEFAULT article (e.g.
evert-speaks-on-rally-to-rebuild) has NO padding band → ~25px gap from the H1's own line-box leading; only a few
(e.g. Aerie) author an extra padding-top band. Matched the common/default case: first-section padding-top 64→24px
desktop (verified: 24px pad → 24px gap ≈ source 25px), 32→8px mobile. Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓. Renders on
preview once published.

### 2026-09-08 — News H1→body gap matched to source (was too tight)
User: the body content sits too close under the H1 vs the source. Measured H1-bottom→first-body-paragraph gap:
source ~89px mobile / ~105px desktop; migrated only ~54px. The source leaves a big gap below the article headline.
Reproduced via the news H1's bottom margin (it collapses with the following block's top gap): margin-bottom
10px → 75px mobile / 91px desktop. Verified live-injected: 75→88px mobile (src 89), 91→105px desktop (src 105) —
match. templates/news/news.css only; renders on preview once deployed. Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓.

### 2026-09-08 — News breadcrumb→H1 gap: fix mobile (was 8px, source ~25px)
Desktop was already right (24px→~24px gap). Mobile first-section padding was only 8px → breadcrumb→H1 gap 8px vs
source 25px. Bumped mobile first-section padding-top 8→24px (verified injected: 24px pad → 24px gap ≈ source 25px);
now both breakpoints use 24px so the redundant 768 media query was removed. templates/news/news.css only. Gates:
lint 0 · breakpoints ✓.

### 2026-09-08 — Header top blue bar: thinner on mobile (5px), 8px desktop
The top blue accent bar was a flat 8px at all widths; the source is 5px on mobile, 8px from desktop (measured 5px
@430 / 8px @1280). blocks/header/header.css: base border-top 8px → 5px, added an 8px override in the ≥992 media
query. Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓.

### 2026-09-08 — Mobile header: chevron parity + panel slide-from-left with close animation
Two mobile-nav fixes (blocks/header/header.css):
1. CHEVRON — the mobile drop-toggle used a small BLUE triangle (border 5/5/6px, brand-blue); source uses the SAME
   grey chevron as desktop. Matched desktop: 18×12 grey triangle (border-left/right 9px transparent, border-top 12px
   rgb(110 114 119)).
2. SLIDE DIRECTION + CLOSE ANIMATION — panel slid in from the RIGHT (translateX(100%)) and, on close,
   `visibility:hidden` snapped it away with no animation. Source parks the menu off-screen LEFT and animates in.
   Fixed: transform translateX(-100%) (slide from left); keep the 0.3s transform transition in BOTH states; delay
   visibility on close (`transition: transform .3s, visibility 0s linear .3s`) and apply it immediately on open
   (`…visibility 0s linear 0s`) so the slide-OUT is visible before the panel hides. JS only toggles aria-expanded
   (no display:none), so the CSS transition drives both directions. Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓.

### 2026-09-08 — Media-columns: capture LISTS beside the image (frances-tiafoe fund page)
frances-tiafoe-fund-surpasses-1-million-raised dropped its bulleted list (3 grant types) — the list sat in the
left col-6 BESIDE the image, but wrapMediaColumns' beside-image pairing only queried <p> (and excluded p-in-ul),
so the <ul> was neither captured in the media block nor left as default content. Fixed: the geometric beside-image
capture (and the DOM-sibling fallback) now select top-level BLOCKS — <p> AND <ul>/<ol> — preserving document order,
skipping nested lists, p-inside-list, and the related-cards feed lists. Re-imported: bullets now present (3 li) with
intro + quote in order. Re-verified jabeiro (3 alternating media), laver ("Located in…" text intact), aerie (1
media) — no regressions. Gates: lint 0. Note: pages whose lists are NOT beside an image were already fine (top-level
lists survive WebImporter as default content).

### 2026-09-08 — Instagram beside text → split-left section; /reel/ + /tv/ permalinks
how-the-usta-foundation-and-realize-the-dream page dropped its Instagram embed entirely. Two causes:
1. instaPermalinkFrom only matched /p/ — this embed is a /reel/ (video), so the permalink came back empty and the
   block was dropped. Fixed: match /p/, /reel/ AND /tv/, keeping the type in the rebuilt permalink; wrapEmbeds iframe
   selector broadened from instagram.com/p/ to instagram.com/.
2. The IG embed sits in a col BESIDE text (embed-left / text-right) — there was no IG equivalent of the tweet
   split-left handling. Refactored the tweet split logic into a shared buildSplitLeftSection(), and added
   wrapInstagramSections() that wraps an IG-beside-text embed as an embed-instagram block in a split-left section
   (runs before wrapEmbeds; full-width IG embeds fall through to the inline handler). Verified: realize-the-dream now
   has embed-instagram in a split-left section with the beside-text; page metadata intact; ngounoue's 2 standalone
   full-width IG embeds still render inline (no split), no regression. Gates: lint 0.

### 2026-09-08 — newport-njtl-honor-chris-evert: IG split-left + hidden-dup dedup
Re-imported to pick up the IG-split-left fix. Its IG embed sits beside text → now an embed-instagram block in a
split-left section (IG left, "TeamFAME serves…" text right). Also found the source ships the IG iframe TWICE (one
visible, one width=0 hidden dup) — same pattern as tweets — which produced a 2nd stray inline embed. Extended the
isHiddenDup guard to BOTH IG paths (wrapInstagramSections + wrapEmbeds blockquote/iframe handlers) so hidden
duplicate embeds are dropped. Result: exactly 1 embed-instagram (split-left). Regression check: ngounoue's 2
DISTINCT IG posts (CP-j8egAsRO, CQBRMbwgdav) both still present. Localized (0 hotlinks). Gates: lint 0.

### 2026-09-08 — Single-column grade winners list → table (2026 NJTL essay winners)
usta-foundation-celebrates-2026-njtl-essay-contest-winners-at-us authors its winners as a SINGLE col-12 list
("…following categories:" + Freshmen/Sophomores/Juniors/Seniors groups, each a header + "Name - Chapter" lines,
blank-separated) — not the two-col layout wrapDataTables handles, so it was importing as plain paragraphs. Added
wrapGradeListTable(): after a "following categories:" lead-in, detect group headers (Freshmen/Sophomores/…/boys/
girls/N-and-under) and "Name - Chapter" lines (split on the dash), emit a Table block (Winner | NJTL Chapter) with a
sub-heading row per group + a row per winner. Replaces only the group run (lead-in + earlier paras stay content).
Verified: proper table w/ 4 groups × 2 winners. Regression: 2023-essay 2-col table unchanged (its wrapDataTables
path; grade-list detector requires the "following categories:" lead-in it lacks). Localized. Gates: lint 0.

### 2026-09-08 — Video-embed: full-width (col-12) → centered block, not forced split-right
usta-foundation-pledges-800-000-service-hours page rendered its video as a half-width split-right when the source
has it FULL-WIDTH/centered (col-12). Bug in wrapVideoSections: it matched the video's column via
`.closest('[GridColumn--default--6]') || .closest('[GridColumn]')` — for a col-12 video the fallback matched the
col-12 and it then treated the preceding col-12 paragraph as fake beside-text and forced a split-right section.
Fixed: only build the split-right section when the video sits in a PARTIAL-width col (5/6/7) with a genuine adjacent
TEXT-only sibling column; otherwise emit a plain full-width video-embed block in place. Verified: pledges page →
plain video-embed (split-right=0, centered); community-impact-hub (video genuinely beside text) → still video-embed
+ split-right section. Localized. Gates: lint 0.

### 2026-09-08 — Revert grade-list→table (2026 NJTL essay winners): source is a plain list
Correction: the previous turn converted the 2026 NJTL essay winners single-column list into a table, but the SOURCE
renders it as a PLAIN paragraph list (grade headers + "Name - Chapter" lines), not a table. Removed
wrapGradeListTable() and its transform call; the list now imports as default-content paragraphs matching the source
(0 table blocks; all 8 winners + Freshmen/Sophomores/Juniors/Seniors headers present in order). Only the genuine
TWO-COLUMN "Winners | NJTL Chapter" layout (2023 essay page) still becomes a table via wrapDataTables. Localized.
Gates: lint 0.

### 2026-09-08 — 2026 NJTL essay winners → SINGLE-column list table (one row per group)
Correction of the prior revert: the winners ARE a table, but a ONE-COLUMN list table — each grade group (Freshmen /
Sophomores / Juniors / Seniors) is its own ROW containing its header + "Name - Chapter" lines (kept as-is), NOT a
two-column Winner|Chapter split. Re-added wrapGradeListTable() building one single-cell row per group (detected via
the "…following categories:" lead-in + group-header lines). table.js: added an isList path — when every row has 1
cell, render `.table-list > .table-list-group` (no <table>, no header row) so each group is a spaced block. table.css:
`.table-list-group` 24px bottom gap between groups, tight lines within. Verified: 4 rows (Freshmen…Seniors) each with
header + 2 winner lines. Localized. Gates: lint 0 · breakpoints ✓.

### 2026-09-08 — Known-good backup of the news importer
Per the Content-Import Rule ("back up the known-good script/manifest"), froze the verified news importer at
tools/importer/backups/news/: import-news-v1.js (SHA1 0190543f…) + import-news-v1.bundle.js + urls-news.txt +
manifest.md. The manifest documents restore steps and the full source→block coverage map (metadata, cards-news,
columns-media L/R, social L/R auto, reactions, quote-tweet inline/split-left, embed-instagram inline/split-left
incl. /reel/+/tv/ + hidden-dup dedup, video-embed full/split-right, 2-col + single-col list tables, layout-table
flatten) with per-block page counts across the 72-page fleet. Added `tools/importer/backups/**` +
`tools/importer/**/*.bundle.js` to .eslintignore. Gate: lint 0.

### 2026-09-08 — Migrate who-we-are/leadership-and-staff (new template: leadership)
Built tools/importer/import-leadership-v1.js — the second page template after news. Target shape = the approved
content/drafts/block-samples/toc-profile.plain.html. Structure: H1 + `toc-profile` tabs (Staff / Board of Directors)
→ Staff section (Our Staff h3 + `cards (profile)`×8 + 18-line staff `<p>` list + Section Metadata profile-anchor:
staff) → Board section (h3 + `cards (profile)`×2 + `table (directory)` 3 cols + profile-anchor: board-of-directors)
→ metadata (Template=leadership). Source detail: cards are `.cmp-teaser` in `role=tabpanel[data-title]` panels; name
from `.cmp-teaser__title_scalable` (visible, not the hidden link copy); board dir dedupes the `--default--hide`
responsive twin column. Imported 84.9% (heavy teaser/duplicate markup stripped; all content captured — verified: 8
staff cards, 18 list lines, 2 board cards, 3 dir columns), 10 images localized (0 hotlinks). Backed up to
tools/importer/backups/leadership/ (script + bundle + urls + manifest). Gate: lint 0 errors.
NOTE: the `leadership` template has no templates/leadership/ CSS/JS yet — the page relies on the toc-profile/cards/
table block styles. If per-template tweaks are needed (e.g. section spacing/H1 color), add templates/leadership/.

### 2026-09-08 — Leadership page: rasterize SVG headshots (DA image validation 409)
DA preview rejected the page: "Images 2 and 5 have failed validation." Cause: two staff headshots (Kim Borza
Donaldson, Kasey O'Connor) were exported by the source as **SVG-wrapped rasters** (Inkscape `<image
xlink:href="data:image/jpeg;base64,…">`, 2.8MB/815KB) — DA's pipeline rejects SVG as a content-image source.
Fix: extracted the embedded base64 JPEG from each SVG (decoding &#10; entities + stripping whitespace),
wrote real .jpeg files (same media-<hash> stem, .svg→.jpeg), downscaled to 500×750 @q82 (~33KB/44KB) with
ImageMagick, and rewrote the .plain.html refs .svg→.jpeg. Also downscaled the oversized Ginny Ehrlich headshot
(1500² 870KB → 750² 90KB). Final: 10/10 images real rasters, 0 SVGs, none >100KB. NOTE for future imports:
localize-assets keeps source SVGs as-is; SVG-wrapped raster headshots must be rasterized before DA publish.

### 2026-09-08 — Leadership page parity fixes + Template→Theme (CSS-only page)
Three source-parity fixes on who-we-are/leadership-and-staff:
1. **Breadcrumb→H1 gap** was 80px (global `h1` carries `margin-top: 0.8em` ≈ 80px at the 100px display size) vs the
   source's **41px** (source H1 has margin 0). Fixed as a **page theme**, not a template: styled `body.leadership`
   in the GLOBAL styles.css — `main > .section:first-of-type { padding-top: 41px }` + `main h1 { margin-top: 0 }`.
2. **Profile card decoration** — source `.tile .cmp-teaser` has `border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.05)` +
   `border-radius: 4px` on top of the box-shadow. This is NOT page-specific (applies to every profile tile), so
   added it to the shared `blocks/cards/cards.css` `.cards.profile > ul > li` (+ `overflow: hidden` to clip the
   square photo to the rounded top corners).
3. **Kim Borza Donaldson image "not properly placed"** — her extracted headshot is a 500×750 PORTRAIT (from the
   SVG-wrapped raster); a centered square crop framed the chest. Source uses `object-position: 50% 0%` (top-
   anchored — the SVG lays the 1504×2256 portrait into the 1500² square showing only the top ~66.5%). Added
   `object-position: 50% 0%` to `.cards.profile .cards-profile-card-image img` so `object-fit: cover` takes the
   top square — faces framed correctly for both taller portraits (Kim, Kasey).

**Template→Theme decision:** switched the importer's metadata row from `Template: leadership` to `Theme: leadership`.
Rationale: this is a CSS-only page. `decorateTemplateAndTheme()` (aem.js) adds BOTH template and theme metadata as
`<body>` classes, but scripts.js additionally does an EAGER `loadCSS(templates/<name>/<name>.css)` for `template` —
which would 404 for a template stylesheet we intentionally don't have. `theme` adds the `body.leadership` class with
**no extra fetch**, and the same class drives the global-sheet rules above. Deleted the stub templates/leadership/.
Re-bundled + re-imported (SHA1 c2148877…); re-localized assets (0 hotlinks) and re-rasterized the two SVG headshots
(re-import reverts both — documented in the leadership backup manifest as required post-import steps).
Gates (all pass): lint 0 errors; breakpoint-check ✓; overflow 360/768/992/1200/1920 ✓; typography 390/768/992/1200 ✓;
a11y ✓. Verified crumb→H1 = 41px and card border/radius/crop against the source live DOM.

### 2026-09-08 — Migrate who-we-are (new template: general) + hero text-up variant + width system
Built tools/importer/import-general-v1.js — third page template (marketing/landing interior pages). Section map:
hero (text-up) → centered intro (center, medium) → History columns (image-right) → FULL-BLEED YELLOW BAND
[leadership intro (section-yellow, center) + Evert columns image-left (section-yellow) — two adjacent same-colour
sections butt into one continuous band] → Supporters intro (center, wide) → cards (tiles). `Theme = general`. 7 images
localized (0 hotlinks). Backed up to tools/importer/backups/general/.

**NEW hero variant `text-up`** (blocks/hero/hero.{js,css}): the interior-page hero. Unlike `banner` (homepage/our-
impact — text vertically CENTERED, photo a FIXED CSS asset dimmed by a 40% overlay), `text-up` takes the AUTHORED
image as the background (hero.js pulls the row-1 <img> src onto the block's background-image), places the text panel
TOP-left, and has NO overlay. Source-measured: inner padding 16/112 (mobile) → 32/224 (desktop); h1 white 54→100px;
subhead white 16→18px; two blue (#0373f3) buttons 40px tall, 3px radius, STACKED on mobile → side-by-side from 768.
Hero height is content + those fixed pads (no min-height/aspect) — since our type scale matches the source, the text
wraps to the same line counts → the band height matches the source at every breakpoint automatically.

**NEW generic width section-styles `medium` / `wide`** (styles.css): the source lays centered copy bands on the
12-col grid at spans narrower than full content, and DIFFERENT per band — `narrow` (810) fit neither. Measured:
medium = 708@768 / 772@992 / 970@1200 (the "mission intro"); wide = 708@768 / 902@992 / 1170@1200 (the "supporters"
band, = full content width). Both centered via `center`. Each breakpoint set explicitly (the `.section.medium/.wide`
rule must outspecify the global mobile 328 cap at the larger tiers).

**Parity fixes to shared blocks:**
- columns.css — a text cell that LEADS with a heading (e.g. "Our History") now zeroes that heading's top margin
  (`.columns > div > div > :is(h1..h6):first-child { margin-top: 0 }`) so it top-aligns with the image beside it;
  the global `h2 { margin-top: 0.8em }` was pushing it down and unbalancing the row.
- cards.css (tiles) — `align-self: start` on each tile so the grid doesn't stretch a shorter tile to the tallest
  row height (source tiles keep their own image height; the two 300×300 images are a touch taller than the 295×282).

### 2026-09-08 — hero text-up MOBILE parity fix (height + panel width)
The migrated mobile hero was 431px vs the source's 625px (@390) — too short, text panel too wide. Root cause: my
mobile CSS used a 325px panel (subhead wrapped to only 3 lines) and 16/112 padding. Measured the source across
360/390/430/500/600/767: the source constrains the mobile text to a NARROW ≈56vw column (202@360 → 284@500), so the
h1 wraps "About the USTA / Foundation" and the subhead wraps to 4–5 lines; the h1 starts 48px from the hero top and
the band runs ~250px below the buttons. Fix (blocks/hero/hero.css `.hero.text-up`): mobile `padding: 48px 32px 250px`
+ panel `max-width: 56vw`. Verified by injecting the CSS onto the live page: hero height now 708/625/625/601 at
360/390/430/500 — EXACT match to the source at every mobile width (h1 top 48, subhead line counts 5/4/4/3 all match).
Buttons stay 48vw stacked (187@390). Gate: lint 0 errors, breakpoint-check ✓.

### 2026-09-08 — who-we-are round 2 fixes (quote block, split-right, button, black band)
- **LEARN MORE button unstyled** — decorateButtons() (scripts.js) only buttonizes a `<p><a>` wrapped in `<strong>`/
  `<em>`; the importer emitted a bare `<p><a>`. Fix: ctaParagraph() now wraps the link in `<strong>`. `<strong>`
  applies `.primary` (black), but the source CTA is brand-blue — added a `body.general .default-content-wrapper
  a.button` override in styles.css that restores the source blue pill (brand-blue, 3px radius, 18px semibold, white).
- **Evert testimonial → Quote block in split-right** — reworked from a columns block to the source-faithful structure:
  the Evert PHOTO as default content (LEFT) + a **Quote block** (RIGHT), laid out by `section-yellow, split-right`
  (default content left / block right). Quote block reused as-is per user decision (32px bold-italic pull-quote).
- **Missing black band above footer** — the source stacks a full-bleed 17px BLACK strip between the last section and
  the footer (same as the homepage `TRAILING_BANDS`). Added a trailing Spacer block (`stats-band-bg` = #000, 17px) as
  its own section before the metadata. (The yellow band was already present via `section-yellow`.)
- **columns leading-heading gap** — zeroed `.columns > div > div > :is(h1..h6):first-child { margin-top }` so
  "Our History" top-aligns with the photo (global h2 0.8em was pushing it down).
Re-imported (7 images, 0 hotlinks), backup refreshed. Gates: lint 0 errors, breakpoint-check ✓. Visual parity +
remaining page-render gates (overflow/typography/a11y) to be confirmed on the deployed page.

### 2026-09-08 — who-we-are round 4: verified deploy + exact button box + bold-ITALIC Evert attribution
Resolved the handoff's "BLOCKER #1" (stale 34-line CSS) — it was a **measurement error**: the CDN serves
`styles.css` gzip-compressed and the verification `curl` wasn't decompressing, so `wc -l` counted binary. With
`curl --compressed`, live + preview both serve the full **938-line** CSS (`body.general` ×13, `medium`/`wide` ×9);
GitHub `main`, the code-bus, and the CDN are all at `cb94155`. **The CSS was already deployed** — no push/opt-in
needed. Confirmed the blue LEARN MORE button renders correctly on live (`body.general appear`, bg rgb(3,115,243)).
The "black button" in the earlier DevTools screenshot was a transient eager-phase capture (before
`decorateTemplateAndTheme()` adds the `general` body class) / stale cache — the fully-loaded page is blue on both
live and local.

Two **real** parity deltas found by measuring the live source (Graphik-loaded, DPR2) vs ours and fixed:
1. **Button box** — source CTA is "Graphik Semibold" at **font-weight 400** (the semibold face is baked into the
   font file; weight 600 synthetically over-bolds it), `box-sizing:border-box`, **height 40px**, **padding 14px**
   (0 vertical since height is fixed + flex-centered), 1px border, 3px radius, ~170px wide. Ours was fw600 /
   `padding:10px 14px` / no explicit height. Fixed the `body.general main a.button*` override in styles.css:
   `font-weight:400` + `height:40px` + `padding:0 14px`. Verified local: fw400, Graphik Semibold, h40, radius 3px
   (width 157 vs source 170 — 13px under; padding-driven, not hardcoded, acceptable for lift-and-shift).
2. **"Chris Evert, Chairperson"** — source is bold **ITALIC** (an `<i>` at fw700 italic); ours was bold-only
   (`<strong>`). Fixed in import-general-v1.js: attribution now `<strong><em>` → EDS renders bold+italic. Re-bundled
   (esbuild + `/* eslint-disable */` prepend), re-imported who-we-are (85.8%, expected — dup desktop/mobile text
   deduped), re-localized (7 images, **0 hotlinks**). Output verified: `<em><strong>Chris Evert, Chairperson</strong></em>`.
Backup refreshed → `tools/importer/backups/general/` (new SHA1 `549c42a4…`, manifest round-4).

on next DA upload of who-we-are.plain.html (dev server serves `/en/**` from the DA bus, so the italic won't render
on localhost until uploaded — the button fix DOES render locally since CSS is served from the working copy).

### 2026-09-08 — who-we-are round 5: missing leading YELLOW STRIP above the yellow band
User flagged a white seam directly above "Our Leadership and Staff". Measured the live source at the History→band
seam (full-bleed bg sampling at x=5): the source stacks **yellow strip (~17px) → white gap (~17px) → main yellow
band** — exactly the homepage colored-spacer pattern (`cards-band-bg` blue strip, `stats-band-bg` black strip). Ours
had NO strip — the yellow band began flush at the heading.
- **Importer:** added SECTION 3b — a Spacer block (`color: section-yellow-bg` #ffefbe, `desktop: 17px`) in its own
  section between History (SECTION 3) and the yellow band (SECTION 4). Re-bundled, re-imported (85.9%), re-localized
  (7 images, 0 hotlinks). Content now has 2 spacers (leading yellow strip + trailing black band).
- **styles.css:** added the `:has(.spacer[style*='section-yellow-bg'])` rules mirroring the blue-strip ones — the
  spacer section floats **40px above / 17px white gap below** (mobile), **56px / 17px** ≥992, and the following
  `.section-yellow` band gets `margin-top: 0` so it butts the white gap. (spacer.js `resolveColor` turns the token
  name into `var(--section-yellow-bg)`, so the inline style contains the `section-yellow-bg` substring the `:has()`
  selector keys on.)
- **Verified** (DOM-injection on the live-served page, since localhost serves `/en/**` from the DA bus so the new
  strip won't render locally until uploaded): strip 17px tall, bg rgb(255,239,190)=#ffefbe (matches source),
  section margin 56/17, band margin-top 0, 17px white gap strip→band — reproduces the source seam exactly.

### 2026-09-08 — who-we-are: confirmed "Chris Evert" bold-italic deployed
"Chris Evert, Chairperson" DID deploy correctly — live renders it `<em><strong>` computed **fw 700 + italic**
(bold italic, matches source); the earlier non-bold screenshot was the pre-DA-upload state.

### 2026-09-08 — who-we-are round 6: supporters CTA had no breathing room below it (button flush to section edge)
User (with a DevTools overlay) showed the LEARN MORE button in the "Our Supporters" band sits FLUSH at the section's
bottom edge, so the cards-tiles section below is jammed close — the gap should belong to the section regardless of
what content ends it, not be occupied by the button. Measured: source button-bottom→first-card-image **70px**, ours
**40px**; ours `spaceBtnToSecBottom: 0` (button touches the boundary) vs the source keeping room below. Root cause:
the `p.button-wrapper` 12px bottom margin COLLAPSES into the section boundary (section `padding-bottom: 0`), so a
section ENDING in a CTA has zero buffer and only the 40px section-margin separates it from the next section.
- **Fix (styles.css, CSS-only):** guaranteed bottom breathing room via PADDING (padding doesn't collapse) on a
  general-page section whose LAST content is a CTA button —
  `body.general main > .section:has(> .default-content-wrapper:last-child > p.button-wrapper:last-child)
  { padding-bottom: 30px }` (+ zero that button-wrapper's own bottom margin). 30px pad + 40px margin = **70px**
  button→cards, exact source match. Independent of trailing-content type; NOT a per-section magic margin — a
  reusable `:has(...ends in CTA)` rule. Verified only the `center wide` supporters section (ends in a button) gets
  the 30px; the `center medium` intro (ends in a paragraph) and the yellow band are unaffected.
- Verified local: gap now 70px; supporters section padding-bottom 30px; no other section changed.
- (Earlier this turn I tried a `.cards-container { margin-top: 70px }` override and reverted it — that was the wrong
  model; the space must live in the SECTION that ends in the button, as padding, per this fix.)

### 2026-09-08 — who-we-are round 7: hero text-up — washed-out image, height, panel position/dimensions
Source-vs-migrated hero comparison showed the migrated hero (a) LIGHTER/softer image, (b) shorter, (c) text panel
mispositioned/mis-sized. Measured all three vs the live source and fixed:
1. **LIGHTER image = low-res rendition.** hero.js set the full-bleed background from `bgImg.src`, which is the EDS
   **?width=750** rendition — stretched over a 1280–1920px hero it looked soft/washed-out vs the source's full-res
   `who-we-are-header.jpg` (1920×1080). Fix (blocks/hero/hero.js): rewrite the bg URL's `width=750` → **`width=2000`**
   (or append `?width=2000&format=webply&optimize=medium` if absent) so the full-bleed photo is sharp + matches the
   source tone. NOT a dimming/overlay issue — measured: neither site has a hero overlay (text-up has no dark layer,
   unlike banner).
2. **HERO HEIGHT too short.** Source vertical framing (measured 1200–1920): top→h1 **80px**, buttons→bottom **378px**
   constant; band height then follows the wrapping text (782 @992–1280 → 672 @1440 → 648 @1920). Ours used
   `padding: 32px 0 224px` → 580px (~200 short). Fix: desktop padding → **`80px 0 378px`**.
3. **PANEL POSITION/DIMENSIONS.** Source text-up panel is FLUID across the WHOLE ≥768 range: width exactly **50vw**,
   left exactly **8.333vw** (768→384/64 … 1920→960/160), with a **15px inner gutter** (Bootstrap column padding) so
   the h1 sits 15px in (left 122 vs panel 107 @1280) and its content width is panel−30 → wraps like the source. Ours
   used a banner-derived `min(50vw−90)/min(8.333vw+45)` (capped, offset) with no inner gutter → h1 15px too far left,
   30px too wide, wrong wrap (2 lines @1440 where source is 1). Fix: unified the ≥768 panel to plain `width: 50vw;
   margin-left: 8.333vw` (removed the redundant ≥992 override) + added `.hero.text-up.block > div > div { padding:
   0 15px }`. Verified EXACT match @992/1280/1440/1920 (h1 left 98/122/135/175, width 466/610/690/930, lines 2/2/1/1,
   height 782/782/672/648); @768 within ~9px (source's 768 inner gutter is 6px vs our 15px — negligible edge case).
   Mobile heights (708/625/625/601 @360/390/430/500) unchanged.

### 2026-09-08 — who-we-are round 8: hero text-up 40% black overlay (correcting round-7's "no overlay")
Round 7 claimed the text-up hero has NO dark overlay — WRONG. Re-scanned the source (my first scan only checked
position:absolute/fixed elements; this overlay is an IN-FLOW `cmp-container`): the source composites a **full-cover
`rgba(0,0,0,0.4)` layer** over the photo (exact hero size 1280×782, behind the text), same treatment as the `banner`
variant. That's why the source reads darker/richer and the white text stays legible. Fix (blocks/hero/hero.js): the
text-up bg is now `linear-gradient(rgba(0,0,0,0.4), rgba(0,0,0,0.4)), url(...)` — the gradient dims the photo while
`background-size: cover` still applies. Verified: overlay renders, image darkened to match source, a11y contrast ✓.

### 2026-09-08 — who-we-are round 9: hero text-up CTA buttons — fluid width + 30px gap
Source-vs-migrated CTA comparison. Measured both across 768–1920: the source buttons are NOT fixed-width — from
992 they're **FLUID** (~29% of the 50vw panel: 148@992, 183@1280, 210@1440, 237@1600, 290@1920) with a **30px**
inter-button gap; at 768–991 they're **content-width** (~148/142px, 14px padding). Ours were a FIXED ~178px (24px
padding) with a 21px gap — so on wide screens the source grew and ours stayed put (the mismatch the screenshots
showed), and the gap was wrong. Fixes (blocks/hero/hero.css):
- **≥768–991:** button `width: auto; padding: 14px` (source's 14px padding, not 24px — else the two buttons + 30px
  gap overflow the 384px @768 panel and wrap to two rows).
- **≥992:** button `width: 14.5vw` (tracks the source's fluid growth within ~10px across 992–1920).
- **Gap:** `.button-container + .button-container { margin-left: 25px }` — 30px source gutter minus the ~5px
  inline-block whitespace between the two containers → measured 30px at every width.
Verified: @768/900 content-width same-row 30px gap; @992–1920 fluid 144/186/209/278 (src 148/183/210/290) 30px gap;
mobile stacked 48vw (187/206/240) unchanged. Gates: lint 0 · breakpoint ✓ · overflow ✓ · typography ✓ · a11y ✓.

### 2026-09-08 — Migrate get-involved (general template, dedicated per-page importer)
get-involved.html is a general-template landing page but with a UNIQUE section sequence, so — per direction — it gets
its OWN dedicated importer (`tools/importer/import-get-involved-v1.js`) built block-by-block, NOT the who-we-are
importer (the generic importer is only worth it across pages sharing a layout, like news). Analyzed the source live
(media side by image centre-X vs midline; yellow bands by inline #FFEFBE). Section sequence:
hero(text-up) → "Your gift powers our mission" intro (center,medium) → Individual Supporters columns (image-RIGHT) →
YELLOW BAND Impact Societies columns (image-LEFT)+LEARN MORE(pdf) → YPI columns (image-RIGHT)+LEARN MORE →
YELLOW BAND Planned Giving columns (image-LEFT)+LEARN MORE(pdf) → Signature Events intro + **Cards (content)** ×3
(Gala/Pro-Am/Fantasy Camps) → YELLOW BAND Corporate Partnership columns (image-LEFT) → trailing black band. Each
yellow band preceded by a Spacer yellow-strip (the who-we-are pattern). `Theme=general`.
- Reused the general importer's helpers (sectionOfHeading/collectText/nearbyImage/ctaParagraph/cloneImg) + a new
  `columnsBlock({imageSide})` (image cell first = left, text first = right — columns.js keys layout on cell order).
- Fix during build: Individual Supporters lives in its OWN .container (not the gift-intro one) → captured via its own
  sectionOfHeading (first pass filtered the wrong container → empty text cell). Signature Events card copy
  canonicalized in the script (source ships mobile-fragment dupes of the Fantasy Camp text).
- Imported 78.5% (dedupe of desktop/mobile copies — expected), localized 9 images (**0 hotlinks**). All headings +
  columns text + 3 card descriptions present; 3 yellow strips + 3 bands + trailing black band in order. Backed up to
  `tools/importer/backups/get-involved/` (SHA1 `7d9ee583…` + manifest). Gate: lint **0 errors**.
- **Follow-up:** the LEARN MORE **PDF links** still point at the source domain — no doc-localizer exists yet (images
  only). Localize to `content/assets/docs/…` when a doc-finalize step is added (also needed for financials).
- **Render/gates pending DA upload:** the dev server serves `/en/**` from the DA preview bus, so get-involved 404s
  locally until uploaded to DA; overflow/typography/a11y + visual parity to be confirmed on the deployed page.

### 2026-09-08 — get-involved round 2: 4 director-review fixes
Source screenshots flagged four misses; measured each on the live source and fixed:
1. **Missing MAKE A GIFT CTA** (gift intro) — the "Your gift powers our mission" intro has a donate button
   (`https://ustaf.donorsupport.co/-/XVHMWELH`) the importer dropped. Added `giftCta = ctaOf(giftSec.container)` +
   emit it in section 2.
2. **Yellow strips too narrow** — measured the source seam (white → yellow strip → white gap → band): the strip is
   **~30px** (not who-we-are's 17px), then ~16px white. Bumped `yellowStrip()` 17px → **30px**. (`section-yellow`
   band padding was already 32px = source.)
3. **cards-content: 3 cards left-aligned with an empty 4th slot** — `.cards.content > ul` was a fixed
   `repeat(4, 1fr)`. Added `:has(> li:nth-child(3):last-child)` → 3-up and `:nth-child(2):last-child` → 2-up so the
   row always fills width; 4 cards stay 4-up (verified on the cards-content sample — still 4-up one row, no
   regression). Signature Events (3 cards) now spreads 3-up.
4. **Corporate Partnership — missing body + wrong alignment** — the source is a CENTERED heading + "Join a growing
   list…" intro (full width) ABOVE an image-LEFT columns row (the 4 Advance/Amplify/Create/Campaign paras beside the
   Emirates photo). Was one columns block with an empty text cell. ROOT CAUSE: `collectText` read only the FIRST
   `.cmp-text`, but this section has 3 (intro + 2 body dupes). Fixed `collectText` to read **ALL** `.cmp-text` blocks
   in a container (the tag+text de-dupe drops the breakpoint copies) — more robust for every section. Then split
   corporate into centered heading+intro + `columns(image-left)` under `section-yellow, yellow-center-intro`.
Re-imported (83.2%, up from 78.5%), localized (9 images, **0 hotlinks**). Verified in output: MAKE A GIFT present,
30px strips, corporate has all 4 body paras + center-intro, cards-content adapts. Backup refreshed (SHA1 `5b5f4d34…`).

### 2026-09-08 — get-involved round 3: yellow-band vertical padding + columns gutter (measured on the deployed page)
get-involved is now on the DA bus, so measured LIVE vs source. Image position (55–625, w570), heading (655–1225),
30px img→text gap, and blue 40px/3px button ALL matched. Two real diffs:
1. **Yellow band too SHORT** — Impact Societies band: source **764px**, ours **551px** (213px short). Both had
   `section-yellow` 32px padding, but the SOURCE nests AEM containers whose padding stacks to a band-top→content gap
   of **~137px top / ~140px bottom** (measured), not 32px. Reproduced: a `section-yellow` band that leads directly
   with a columns block (Impact/Planned — NOT the `yellow-center-intro` bands) gets extra vertical padding at ≥992
   (scoped via `:not(.yellow-center-intro):has(> .columns-wrapper:first-child)`). NOTE: the full source 137/140
   looked too tall in review — per direction, HALVED to **`68px 0 70px`** (Impact band → 625px, comfortable). Corporate
   stays center-intro at 32px; who-we-are's leadership band is `yellow-center-intro` so unaffected.
2. **Columns gutter** 24px → **30px** (`.columns > div` gap at ≥992 = `var(--grid-gap)`) — source img→text gap is 30px
   (the stacked-mobile 24px stays on the base rule). Affects all columns blocks; matches the source grid.

### 2026-09-08 — Migrate what-we-do (general template, dedicated per-page importer)
Built `tools/importer/import-what-we-do-v1.js`. Section sequence (analyzed live): hero(text-up)+JOIN US →
"Our Strategic Priorities" intro + Cards(content)×4 → YELLOW BAND "Transforming lives since 1969." (center-intro +
Columns image-LEFT: photo + H3 "Carrying on the legacy" + paras + LEARN MORE→our-impact) → "The NJTL network serves…"
+ WIDE full-width map image → "Sustained support…" intro + Cards(content)×4 → black band. `Theme=general`.
- **NEW `map-wide` section style** (styles.css): near-full-viewport image band (100vw − 16/24/60px gutter across
  mobile/768/992+ = 374/744/932/1220/1380 — matches the source NJTL map, wider than the 1170 content grid). Used WITH
  `center` so the heading above stays centered.
- **Card images: hard-wired DAM paths.** The source card `<img>` is inside a `<noscript>` lazy-load wrapper that the
  cleanup step strips, and the parser doesn't expose it via the h4→walk-up path (unlike the large eager transform/map
  images, found normally). After several empty-cell attempts, wired each card's real `/content/dam/…` asset path
  (verified 200) into the card defs; localize-assets downloads them. Result: **11 images, 0 hotlinks** (was 3).
- **Two CTAs** were missed then added: JOIN US (hero) + LEARN MORE (yellow band → our-impact), both `<strong>`-wrapped
  → blue `body.general` buttons.
- Reused get-involved's helpers (as a copy base) + new `cardsContentBlock()` + `imgFromUrl()`. Imported 82.4%
  (dedupe expected), localized 0 hotlinks. Backed up to `tools/importer/backups/what-we-do/` (SHA1 `3681e914…` +

### 2026-09-08 — hero text-up: per-page height (get-involved/what-we-do were too tall)
The text-up hero desktop bottom padding was hardcoded `378px` (tuned to who-we-are → 782px), making get-involved and
what-we-do too tall. Measured the source bottom pad (buttons→hero-bottom) at 1280: who-we-are **378** (782px total),
get-involved **272** (676px), what-we-do **272** (700px) — top pad a constant 80px on all three. The 378 is the
TWO-CTA who-we-are outlier; the single-CTA pages use 272. Fix (blocks/hero/hero.css ≥768): base `padding-bottom: 272px`
+ `.hero.text-up.block:has(.button-container + .button-container) { padding-bottom: 378px }` (the extra 106px only when
a 2nd button is present — who-we-are). Verified local: who-we-are **782**, get-involved **676**, what-we-do **700** —
all exact source matches. Gates: lint 0 · breakpoint ✓ · overflow ✓. Deploy: hero.css → GitHub push.

**MOBILE height (same issue below 768):** the mobile bottom pad was also hardcoded `250px` (who-we-are's value) → all
pages ~652px flat. Source mobile bottom pad: who-we-are (2-CTA) **250** (708/625/625/601), get-involved/what-we-do
(1-CTA) **144** (689/630/546…). Fixed: base mobile `padding-bottom: 144px` + a base-level
`:has(.button-container + .button-container){ padding-bottom: 250px }` (the ≥768 `:has()` rule at 378px still overrides
on desktop by source order). Verified: who-we-are 708/625/625/601, what-we-do 678/618/594/570, get-involved
546/546/546/522 (desktop 676/700/782 all exact). NOTE: get-involved is ~1 subhead line shorter than source at 360/390
(source panel is **48vw** → 6-line subhead; ours is **56vw** → 5 lines, tuned to who-we-are which genuinely uses 56vw).
The panel width is a per-page author nuance not distinguishable in shared CSS by class/CTA-count; heights match at 430+
and desktop, and the visual is very close — left as-is.

### 2026-09-08 — Migrate our-impact (general template, dedicated importer; hero BANNER variant)
Built `tools/importer/import-our-impact-v1.js`. Section sequence (analyzed live): hero(**banner** — centered white text,
40% overlay, NOT text-up) → "Young people aren't ready." intro + Columns (4 stat blocks LEFT, image RIGHT) → YELLOW
"We reach communities…" intro + Columns (image LEFT, 3-item list RIGHT) → "Our impact is felt…" **banner-stats-grid**
→ YELLOW "We make a difference…" intro + **Cards (stats)** ×4 (97/98/85/95) → black band. `Theme=general`.
- **Hero banner now supports an AUTHORED bg image** (hero.js decorateBanner): pulls a lone row-1 img → inline
  background + 40% overlay gradient at width=2000; homepage banner still uses its fixed CSS asset when no img authored.
  our-impact authors its own our-impact-header.jpg.
- **Stat/card content hard-wired** (same reason as what-we-do): the source packs stat H3+captions into single
  cmp-text blocks and card images sit in `<noscript>` lazy wrappers the cleanup strips. So NOT_READY_STATS,
  REACH_ITEMS, the banner-stats-grid pairs, and STAT_CARDS are authored explicitly (verified DAM paths); only the
  section headings/intros pulled dynamically. banner-stats-grid + cards-stats match the existing block samples.
- Reused get-involved helpers + new `statList()` + `imgFromUrl()`. Imported 84.4%, localized **7 images, 0 hotlinks**.
  Backed up to `tools/importer/backups/our-impact/` (SHA1 `c7286b7c…` + manifest). Gates: lint **0 errors** ·

- **Render/gates pending DA upload:** dev serves `/en/**` from the DA bus → our-impact 404s locally until uploaded;

### 2026-09-08 — our-impact round 2: "We reach communities" labels were huge H3, should be small bold
Director review: the reach-section labels (Nationwide / Community-led / Trusted access) rendered as huge Graphik
XXCond Bold H3 display headings, but the SOURCE renders them as small **`<b>` — 18px bold, Graphik Regular, 24px lh,
black** (measured). (The section-2 "Young people aren't ready" stats ARE big H3 display — 56px XXCond Bold — so those
stay H3; only the reach section differs.) Added a `labelList()` builder emitting `<p><strong>label</strong></p>` +
caption paragraph (vs `statList()`'s H3), and used it for REACH_ITEMS. Verified in output: reach items now
`<p><strong>Nationwide</strong></p>` etc.; section-2 stats still `<h3>`. Re-imported (84.4%), localized (7 img, 0
hotlinks). Backup refreshed (SHA1 `b05aea6c…`). Gates: lint 0 · breakpoint ✓. Renders on DA re-upload.

### 2026-09-08 — our-impact round 3: hero → text-up (per direction, not banner)
Per direction, switched the our-impact hero from `Hero (banner)` to `Hero (text-up)` (top-left text panel, no
overlay — consistent with who-we-are/what-we-do/get-involved). Importer emits `Hero (text-up)` now; the text-up CSS
already pulls the authored bg image at width=2000. (The banner-authored-image support added in round 1 stays in
hero.js — harmless, available for future banner pages.) Re-imported (84.4%), localized (7 img, 0 hotlinks). Backup
refreshed (SHA1 `d5a7c7ee…`). Gates: lint 0 · breakpoint ✓.

### 2026-09-08 — our-impact round 4: back to banner + hero CTA + body.general banner positioning
- Reverted hero to **banner** (per direction), and restored the dropped hero CTA **WHAT WE DO → what-we-do**
  (`heroCta = ctaOf(heroContainer)`, `<strong>`-wrapped → blue).
- **body.general banner positioning** (hero.css): the homepage banner CSS is tuned to the HOMEPAGE hero (h1 left 152,
  height 874 @1280), which didn't match the our-impact source (h1 left 122). Added a `body.general .hero.banner`
  override — same panel geometry as the text-up hero (panel `margin-left: 8.333vw`, `width: 50vw`, 15px inner gutter)
  but with BANNER vertical framing (`padding: 136px 0 200px` desktop, `72px 12px 104px 8.333vw` mobile). Scoped to
  body.general so the **homepage banner is untouched** (verified: home body class is `appear`, h1 left still 152 / 874).
  Verified via DOM-injection on a body.general page: **exact source match at every breakpoint** — @1280 heroH 770,
  h1 top 136, h1 left 122, h1 width 610, button-bottom→hero 200; @360/390/430 heroH 614/614/590, h1 top 72, h1 left
  30/32/36, subhead 6/6/5 lines. Mobile panel set to **50vw** (source column; 56vw wrapped the subhead one line short
  → 24px too short) — heights now match. Homepage banner untouched (body `appear`, not `general`).
- Re-imported, localized (7 img, 0 hotlinks). Gates: lint 0 · breakpoint ✓. Renders on DA re-upload.

### 2026-09-08 — our-impact round 5: banner CTA width (was fixed 238px, source 183px)
Deployed our-impact review: the hero WHAT WE DO button was **238px** wide (the homepage banner CTA is a fixed
`width: 238px` "LEARN MORE" pill), but the source our-impact button is **content-width ~183px** (label + generous
padding). Added to the `body.general .hero.banner a.button` override: `width: auto` + `padding: 14px 24px` → **178px**
(within ~5px of source, consistent with the who-we-are/get-involved CTAs). Homepage banner CTA stays 238px (not
body.general). Gates: lint 0 · breakpoint ✓. CSS-only (hero.css) → next GitHub push.

### 2026-09-08 — our-impact round 6: "We make a difference" intro should be centered
The final yellow section's intro (H2 "We make a difference that matters." + 2 paras + "The numbers speak to it." H2)
rendered LEFT but the source is `text-align: center` across the full 1170 content width. Added `center` to that
section's metadata (`section-yellow, center`) — centers the leading default content; the cards-stats block keeps its
own centered grid. Re-imported (7 img, 0 hotlinks). Gates: lint 0 · breakpoint ✓. Content change → renders on DA re-upload.

### 2026-09-08 — Migrate get-involved/special-funds (general template, dedicated importer)
Built `tools/importer/import-special-funds-v1.js`. Sequence (analyzed live): hero(text-up) "Give to what matters most
to you." → Frances Tiafoe Fund columns image-RIGHT + GIVE A GIFT(?form=TIAFOE) → YELLOW Mackie McDonald College Fund
columns image-LEFT + GIVE A GIFT → Jimmy Evert Merit Scholarship Fund columns image-RIGHT + GIVE A GIFT → **Cards
(expand)** ×5 (JLLI/Dinkins/Tisdel/RSPA/Middle States) → black band. `Theme=general`.
- **Cards-expand from the block sample:** the source cards are cross-origin FundraiseUp iframes (no readable
  content), so the 5 cards (title + desc + Donate ?form=…) + their images come from the approved
  `drafts/block-samples/cards-expand` sample; images reference the already-localized
  `/media-da/drafts/block-samples/cards-expand/…` assets.
- **adjustImageUrls post-fix:** that rule absolutized the media-da card srcs → 404; added a post-pass restoring any
  `/media-da/` src to its relative path. Result: 4 fund photos downloaded, 5 card images stay relative → **0 hotlinks**.
- Fund CTAs + card Donate links are `?form=…` FundraiseUp deep-links (on-origin via scripts/donate.js).
- Imported 83.7%. Backed up to `tools/importer/backups/special-funds/` (SHA1 `e6958464…` + manifest). Gates: lint 0 ·

### 2026-09-08 — special-funds round 2: centered fund H2s, cards-expand intro, spacing
Source review flagged three: (1) each fund NAME (H2) is CENTERED full-width ABOVE its columns (source align:center,
spans 1170) — I'd put the H2 in the columns text cell; (2) the cards-expand grid has a centered intro line "Explore
more of the USTA Foundation's special philanthropic funds:" — was missing; (3) whitespace above the cards-expand.
Fixes:
- Reworked fund emit: the H2 is now a standalone centered heading + a Columns block (body paras + image + GIVE A GIFT)
  in one section; style `center-intro` (white funds) or `section-yellow, yellow-center-intro` (Mackie band).
- **Generalized the CSS** `yellow-center-intro` → added a white `center-intro` variant (centers the leading
  default-content wrapper full-width); `yellow-center-intro` keeps its 970 cap. styles.css.
- Added the cards-expand intro `<p>` + a `center` section style on that section (intro centers; cards keep their grid),
  and an 80px/48px **Spacer above** cards-expand for the source's whitespace.
Re-imported, localized (4 img, **0 hotlinks**). Backup refreshed (SHA1 `3a053770…`). Gates: lint 0 · breakpoint ✓.

### 2026-09-08 — Consolidate section styles: drop `yellow-center-intro`, keep `center-intro`
`yellow-center-intro` was redundant — the yellow BACKGROUND comes from `section-yellow`, so the `yellow-` prefix
conflated a color with a layout. Removed it; `center-intro` is now the single style that centers ONLY the leading
default-content wrapper (heading ± para ± CTA) above a columns block (vs `center`, which centers ALL default content).
Yellow bands now express as `section-yellow, center-intro`. Also dropped the old 970px cap — the source who-we-are
leadership intro paragraph is full 1170 width centered (measured), so `center-intro` (full-width) is MORE accurate.
- styles.css: merged the two rules into one `center-intro`; updated the section-yellow tall-padding `:not()` guard to
  `:not(.center-intro)`.
- Updated ALL 5 importers (general/who-we-are, get-involved, our-impact, what-we-do, special-funds):
  `section-yellow, yellow-center-intro` → `section-yellow, center-intro`. Re-bundled + re-imported all 5, re-localized
  (**0 hotlinks** each: 7/9/7/11/4). All 5 backups refreshed.
- Gates: lint 0 · breakpoint ✓. Renders on DA re-upload of each page.
NOTE: `center` = centers the WHOLE section's default content; `center-intro` = centers only the leading intro wrapper.

### 2026-09-08 — Homepage hero mobile height (was 80px too short)
Home mobile hero-banner was 474px @390 vs the source's 554px. The base `.hero.banner.block` mobile padding was
`72px 12px`, but the source frames the text with **112px above the h1 / 112px below the button** (measured: h1 top 112,
button-bottom→hero-bottom 112). Fixed base mobile padding `72px 12px` → **`112px 12px`**. Verified: @390 hero 554
(exact), @430 495 (exact), h1 top 112, button gap 112. Desktop unaffected (≥768/≥992 tiers own it — @1280 stays 874).
This is the HOMEPAGE banner (body `appear`); the body.general banner override (our-impact) is separate. Gates: lint 0 ·

### 2026-09-08 — Homepage hero LEARN MORE button too wide (fixed 238px → content-width)
`.hero.banner a.button` had a fixed `width: 238px`, but the source LEARN MORE is CONTENT-width (measured 148px @390/768,
163px @1280 — label + 14px padding, not a fixed pill). Removed the fixed width; button now `padding: 14px`, height 40px,
content-sized → **158px** (within ~10px of source across all widths, vs the old 238). our-impact's body.general override
(padding 14px 24px, ~178px matching that page's 183px source button) is separate and unaffected. Gates: lint 0 · breakpoint ✓.
CSS-only (hero.css) → next GitHub push.

### 2026-09-08 — Homepage black stats band mobile height (was 48px too tall)
Home mobile black stats band (columns-stats) was 357px @430 vs the source's 309px. Cause: the mobile flex column
inherited the base `.columns > div { gap: 24px }` stacked gap, adding 24px between each of the 3 stacked stats (48px
total). The source stacks them with NO gap (each item 97px → 309px). Fixed: `.columns.stats > div { gap: 0 }`.
Verified: @430 band now **309** (exact), items abut; desktop 3-across row unaffected (@1280 still 115). Gates: lint 0 ·

### 2026-09-08 — Sample pages: section center-intro / center-wide + Spacer block (all bands)
Added missing sample pages (drafts/):
- `sections-samples/section-center-intro` — demonstrates `center-intro` (centers ONLY the leading intro heading above
  a left-aligned columns block; vs `center` which centers all default content).
- `sections-samples/section-center-wide` — demonstrates `center, wide` (centered intro at the full content measure
  708/902/1170 per breakpoint).
- `block-samples/spacer` — the Spacer block with EVERY band variant: plain gap, yellow (`section-yellow-bg`), blue
  (`section-blue-bg`), cards-band blue (`cards-band-bg`, homepage strip), black (`stats-band-bg`, trailing strip), and
  a raw-color example (#23527c) — each labelled with its `color` token + heights.
All three added to `tests/a11y/a11y.config.js`. Lint 0. NOTE: the running dev server indexes drafts at startup, so new
draft files 404 until a restart/deploy — files are structurally consistent with the existing samples.

### 2026-09-08 — Migrate who-we-are/financials (simplest page: all default content)
Built `tools/importer/import-financials-v1.js`. The page is ALL default content, no hero/blocks: H1 "Annual Reports and
Financial Information" + three H2 sections — Annual Reports (13 PDFs), Audited Financial Statements (intro + 4), IRS
Form 990 (intro + 3) — each a `<ul><li><a>` bulleted list of PDF download links (authored as ul/li so decorateButtons
leaves them plain underlined links, not buttons). Content is a FIXED list hard-wired in the script (deterministic).
`Theme=general`. Imported 73.1% (source footer social/copyright/donor-privacy chrome intentionally excluded — page
chrome, not content). 20 PDF links (13+4+3), 3 lists, 0 images (0 hotlinks). Backed up to

### 2026-09-08 — Migrate news.html listing (blank — matches empty source)
The source `news.html` is genuinely BLANK (empty content grid, no H1, no article feed — the 72 articles are individual
`/news/*` pages; there's no authored index). Per direction, imported a faithful minimal page: metadata only (Title
"News", Theme general), no body. `tools/importer/import-news-listing-v1.js`. Output is `en/home/news.plain.html` (a
FILE, distinct from the `en/home/news/` 72-article directory — verified the dir stays intact at 72). 0 images, 0

### 2026-09-08 — Migrate what-we-do/college-scholarship-opportunities (general template)
Built `tools/importer/import-college-scholarships-v1.js`. Sequence: hero(text-up) "We give young people the keys to
their future." + LEARN MORE(pdf) → "Opening doors of opportunity." intro (center,medium) + Cards(content)×3 (with
images: Launch/Success/Novo Nordisk) → 3 scholarship DETAIL sections, each a centered heading + lead + a 4-up
image-LESS Q&A grid (Cards(content): h4 question + answer): College Launch (yellow), College Success (white), Novo
Nordisk Donnelly (yellow) → black band. `Theme=general`.
- **Generalized cardsContentBlock:** card with image → [imageCell, bodyCell]; card WITHOUT image → body-only
  [bodyCell] (the Q&A detail grids are image-less). All content hard-wired (deterministic); 3 card images are verified
  DAM assets, Q&A text fixed.

### 2026-09-08 — college-scholarships round 2: detail Q&A cards DO have images (were missing)
Correction: I'd wrongly treated the 3 scholarship DETAIL sections as image-LESS Q&A grids. Re-measured the source —
each detail section has a 4-across row of images (cx 190/490/790/1090) below the heading, so each Q&A card is
image + h4 question + answer. Added the 4 images per section to the DETAILS `qa` defs (verified DAM assets; source
filenames include a "scholarship-thumnbnail-*" typo — kept as-is). Re-imported: now **16 images** (was 4: 3 opening
cards + 4×3 detail + hero), 0 hotlinks. Each detail card renders image + h4 + answer. Backup refreshed (SHA1

Stibbins testimonial) LEFT + Custom Form Donate (FundraiseUp CHRIS50) RIGHT → black band. `Theme=general`.
- The donation embed is a cross-origin FundraiseUp iframe, so the split-even quote + custom-form-donate content comes
  from the approved `sections-samples/section-split-even-donate` sample (the sample was built for THIS page).
- Content hard-wired (deterministic). Imported OK, localized **1 image, 0 hotlinks**. Backed up to

### 2026-09-08 — YPI corrections: centered intro split + bold sub-headings + real bullet lists
Two fixes to `import-ypi-v1.js` after comparing to source screenshots:
1. **Missing/mis-structured "What is YPI?" content.** The original importer merged "The future of giving starts here."
   and "What is YPI?" into ONE columns block. Source is actually TWO pieces: (2a) a **centered** intro band
   ("The future…" H2 + one intro para + MAKE A GIFT, all centered → `center` section style) and (2b) a **Columns**
   block (image right) whose text cell is "What is YPI?" + copy. Measured on live: future H2 cx=640 (centered),
   whatis H2 cx=340 (left column). Split them.
2. **Bold / different lettering on the left.** The columns text cell now emits a **bold** lead-in
   ("As a part of…" → `<p><strong>`) and a real `<ul>` **bullet list** (4 items) instead of flat paragraphs.
   Same treatment applied to "How YPI Makes an Impact" (5-item `<ul>`). Verified on live that these items are `<li>`;
   "Ways to Get Involved" is plain paras (no bullets) — left as-is.
- Added an importer mini-format for column bodies: `{p}` para, `{b}` bold sub-heading, `{ul:[…]}` bullet list.
- Re-imported (completeness 79%, expected — verify by eye), localized **5 images, 0 hotlinks**. Backup + manifest
  refreshed. Gates: lint 0 errors · breakpoint ✓ (no CSS change). Renders on DA upload.

### 2026-09-08 — YPI hero too short: new `text-up` `tall` variant (min-height floor)
Source YPI hero is a **fixed-height box** (~601px mobile / ~790px desktop), but our text-up hero is padding-driven
so it follows the (short) YPI copy. Measured source vs migrated: matched at 768 (814/810) and 992 (790/790) but the
migrated collapsed at **1280 (676 vs 790)** and **390 (522 vs 601)** — the YPI h1/subhead wrap to fewer lines there.
Fix: added a scoped **`.hero.text-up.tall`** variant in `blocks/hero/hero.css` with `min-height:601px` (mobile) /
`790px` (≥768). Text stays top-anchored (padding-top unchanged); the background just fills down to the floor; taller
content still wins (768 → 810). Importer now emits `Hero (text-up, tall)`. Verified locally by simulating `.tall` on
the served page: heights → 390:601, 768:810, 992:790, 1280:790 (exact source parity). The plain `text-up` heroes
(who-we-are/get-involved/what-we-do) are untouched. Gates: lint 0 errors · breakpoint ✓. Renders on DA upload.

### 2026-09-08 — Doc-localizer built: financials 20 PDFs → content/assets/docs + absolute aem.live href
The finalize-assets **doc** pipeline (long-standing follow-up) now exists as `tools/assets/localize-docs.mjs`, a
sibling to `localize-assets.mjs`. Model is the OPPOSITE of images: docs are real downloadable assets served from the
site, so they download to `content/assets/docs/{preserved DAM sub-path}` (NO hash names — readable paths kept, so
`annual-reports/2023.pdf` vs `irs-990/2023.pdf` vs `audited-financial-statements/2023.pdf` don't collide) and every
`<a href>` is rewritten to the ABSOLUTE `https://main--foundation-usta--aemdemos.aem.live/assets/docs/…` (base derived
from the git remote). Only doc-extension `<a href>` links are touched; images/pages/mailto untouched. Idempotent.
Docs GO to DA with the `.plain.html` (images' media-da does NOT).
- Ran on financials: **20 PDFs downloaded, 0 leftover hotlinks**; all serve 200 `application/pdf` from the dev server;
  hrefs rewritten to `…aem.live/assets/docs/…`. `content/` is git-ignored (staging), so the PDFs aren't committed —
  they upload to DA. NOTE: the 2024 annual report PDF is **~61 MB** (total assets/docs ≈125 MB).
- Documented in `docs/asset-localization-playbook.md` (new "Document Localization" section) + financials manifest
  (finalize step 2). Gates: lint 0 errors · breakpoint ✓ (`.mjs` tools aren't in `eslint .` scope, same as the
  image sibling). Standing follow-ups elsewhere (get-involved, college-scholarships, chris-evert hero LEARN MORE PDFs)
  can now be finalized the same way: `node tools/assets/localize-docs.mjs <page>`.

### 2026-09-08 — Financials PDFs pushed to DA + published (20 docs live, links normalized)
Uploaded all 20 financials PDFs to the DA source (`assets/docs/…` paths preserved) + previewed/published them, then
re-uploaded the page. Live result: **20 `assets/docs` links, 0 source-domain links**; every PDF resolves 200
`application/pdf`. EDS relativizes the absolute `…aem.live/assets/docs/…` hrefs to same-origin `/assets/docs/…` on
the rendered page (expected). Two gotchas hit + fixed (now in the playbook):
- **DA needs `<body><main>` wrapping.** First page upload POSTed the bare `<div>…` fragment → DA produced an EMPTY
  page (`.md` 0 bytes, links gone). Fix: wrap the upload copy in `<body><main>…</main></body>` (as aem-import-helper's
  `wrapHtmlContent` does). Keep the local `content/…plain.html` a bare fragment; wrap only the uploaded copy.
- **20 MB PDF cap.** The 2024 annual report (61 MB) hit `AEM_BACKEND_PDF_TOO_BIG` (409/404). No gs/qpdf installed →
  compressed with WASM ghostscript (`@jspawn/ghostscript-wasm`, loaded via `instantiateWasm` since Node 24's global
  `fetch` breaks its file-path loader) at `-dPDFSETTINGS=/printer` (300 dpi): **61 MB → 3.0 MB**, 32 pages + image
  quality intact (spot-checked a rendered page). Uploaded + published the compressed version.

### 2026-09-08 — Full-site validation (84 pages): links + breadcrumbs → see VALIDATION.md
Built `tools/quality/audit-site.mjs` (JS-render crawl → extract every `<a href>` → HTTP-check with HEAD→ranged-GET,
dedup, concurrency; capture + compare EDS vs source breadcrumbs) and `tools/quality/audit-breadcrumbs-news.mjs`
(news breadcrumbs re-checked against the CORRECT source URL via source-sitemap prefix match). Results:
- **367 unique links checked, 0 migration-introduced breaks.** The 91 "broken" are all (a) bot-blocked external
  hosts (68 facebook `sharer.php`/social, census/atptour/ticketmaster 403s — fine in a browser), or (b) links dead
  on the SOURCE too (`on-src:true`), incl. 9 `…/stay-current/national/…` related-article links that 404 on source
  itself — a lift-and-shift keeps them verbatim.
- **2 real internal PDFs fixed:** `impact-societies-one-pager.pdf` (get-involved) + `2026-scholarship-program-faq.pdf`
  (college-scholarship-opportunities) were authored as root-relative `/content/dam/…​.pdf` (404 on EDS) and missed by
  the first localize pass (absolute-only). Enhanced `localize-docs.mjs` to resolve root-relative `/content/dam/*.pdf`
  against `--src-host` (default www.ustafoundation.com); both localized to `/assets/docs/pdfs/…`, serve 200 locally.
  **DA upload/publish BLOCKED** — admin.da.live now 401s (credential opt-in turned off); recipe in VALIDATION.md §3.
- **Breadcrumbs: all 84 pages match source EXACTLY** (labels, depth, crumb hrefs; news = `Home > {title}` with the
  `news` segment hidden, matching source). Zero corrections needed. Re-verified the recent pages (YPI, chris-evert,
  college-scholarships, financials) crumb-by-crumb incl. hrefs.

### 2026-09-09 — Root `index` page: replica of en/home served at `/`
Created `content/index.plain.html` as a replica of `en/home.plain.html` (byte-copy of the block/section structure),
uploaded (wrapped in `<body><main>`) to the DA root `index.html`, previewed + published. Served at **`/`** (the EDS
convention: an `index` doc renders at its directory root; a literal `/index` correctly 404s, matching the source home
living at `/`). Verified at `/`: same H1, hero banner, 3 stats cols, 2 feature cols, 4 support cards, all **6 images
loaded (0 about:error)**. Only diff vs `/en/home`: no breadcrumb (root has no path segments — correct) and `<img>`
width/height attrs absent (cosmetic).
- **Media gotcha (non-obvious):** EDS resolves images via DA-localized copies in each doc's SHADOW folder
  (`en/.home/…`), so home's `/media-da/en/home/…` staging paths (local-only, never uploaded) rendered `about:error`
  when copied verbatim to the `index` doc. Fix: rewrote the 6 image refs to the home doc's PUBLIC published renditions
  `https://main--foundation-usta--aemdemos.aem.live/en/home/media_<hash>.<ext>` (mapped 1:1 by alt-text order). On
  preview, EDS recognized these as its own managed assets and re-localized them into the `index` doc as proper
  `./media_<hash>` renditions — 24 refs, 0 errors. When cloning a page across DA paths, DO NOT reuse another doc's
  `/media-da/` staging paths; point at published `…aem.live/<srcdoc>/media_<hash>` renditions and let EDS re-localize.

### 2026-09-09 — All images author-managed: removed code-baked hero + collage images
Audit for hardcoded images found TWO baked into code (rest of the site was already content-driven): the homepage
hero banner photo (`blocks/hero/hero.css` `url('./ustaf-banner-2.jpg')`) and the "For decades…" collage's 3rd
portrait (`blocks/columns/columns.css` `url('./college-bootcamp-hp.jpg')` on `.columns-feature-collage-portrait`).
Per the lift-and-shift rule, ALL images must be author-managed via content. Fixes:
- **Hero:** dropped the CSS `url()`; the block now shows ONLY the 40% overlay by default (on `--brand-blue` as a
  legible no-image fallback), and `hero.js` sets the photo as an inline background from the AUTHORED row-1 `<img>`
  (this authored path already existed — the CSS default was the only baked bit). Added the banner image to the
  hero block content on `/` (index) and `en/home`.
- **Collage:** `columns.js` now builds the tall portrait from the **3rd authored `<img>`** in the cell (first two →
  thumbnail stack, last → portrait) instead of a CSS background; `columns.css` portrait styles the contained `<img>`
  via object-fit and the thumbnail-sizing rules were re-scoped to `.columns-feature-collage-stack img` so they don't
  hit the portrait. Added the 3rd image to content. **Authoring contract:** collage cell = 3 images.
- Deleted the 2 now-unreferenced raster files from `blocks/`. Only `icons/*.svg` + `blocks/hero/icons/*.svg`
  (UI glyphs) remain in code — no content raster images anywhere.
- **DA content-image mechanism (learned):** to add an author-managed image, upload the bytes to the doc's DA SHADOW
  folder (`.{page}/media-<sha1>-<h8>.<ext>`), reference it in the page HTML via
  `https://content.da.live/{org}/{repo}/{shadow}/…`, then publish — EDS localizes it into a `./media_<hash>` rendition
  (verified: hero bg + portrait render from content, 0 CSS images). Staged images also live in `content/media-da/`.
- Verified locally (dev server = local CSS/JS + DA content): hero photo → background under overlay (img row consumed);
  collage portrait = real authored `<img>` (loaded, correct alt, object-fit box 272×401), stack = 2 thumbnails, NO CSS
  background. Screenshots matched the prior look exactly. Gates: lint 0 errors · breakpoint ✓.
- **Deploy:** CSS/JS changes go live on GitHub push (content already updated on DA for `/` + `en/home`).

### 2026-09-09 — Consolidate icons to one root folder + best-practices review
- **Single icons/ folder:** moved `blocks/hero/icons/tennis-ball-bouncing.svg` and the 6
  `blocks/custom-widget-reactions/icons/*.svg` into the repo-root `icons/` (now 8 files, no collisions). Both blocks
  now resolve icons via `window.hlx.codeBasePath + '/icons/'` (the aem.js pattern) instead of block-relative
  `import.meta.url`. One icon folder for the whole repo.
- **CSS review:** breakpoint-check ✓ — ALL media queries are `min-width` only (768/992/1200, the approved set),
  ZERO `max-width` media queries, no min/max mixing. `!important` only in `embed-instagram.css` (overriding Instagram's
  injected inline iframe styles — legitimate). No unscoped block selectors (only `header`/`footer` element roots,
  boilerplate convention). `nth-child` used only for grid-count `:has()` logic (2-up/3-up cards), not per-item.
- **Accessibility review:** axe-core (WCAG A+AA) passes on home/who-we-are/get-involved/college-scholarships/our-impact.
  Alt-text: 0 content images missing an `alt` attribute; JS-generated imgs correct (hero error-ball `alt=""`+aria-hidden
  decorative; reaction icons `alt=label`). Two `outline:none` in custom-form-donate are compensated by `:focus-within`
  outlines on the wrapper (visible focus preserved).
  - **Fixed:** who-we-are "SIGNATURE EVENTS" card tile (`roddick-couric-gala.jpeg`) had `alt=""` — a CONTENT image the
    SOURCE also left empty. Gave it descriptive alt "Andy Roddick and Katie Couric at a USTA Foundation gala"
    (a11y improvement over source). Re-uploaded + published; verified live.
  - **KNOWN (source-fidelity vs best-practice, left as source):** (a) `our-impact` has 2 `<h1>` ("We make a
    transformative…" + the "233,000+ young people served" stat headline) — matches source exactly; axe passes
    (multiple-h1 is best-practice, not A/AA). (b) Heading skips h2→h4 on the cards sections (home, get-involved,
    what-we-do, college-scholarships, who-we-are) and h1→h3 on leadership — the card titles are `<h4>` exactly as the
    source authored them, and their type scale is tuned to h4; axe passes. Flagged for a fidelity-vs-hierarchy decision
    rather than silently re-leveling.
- Gates: lint 0 errors · breakpoint ✓ · check:svg ✓ · a11y ✓. **Deploy:** icon move + JS = GitHub push (branch merged
  via PR #5 earlier; icon commit `19b0db4` on local main pending push); alt fix = DA (done, live).

### 2026-09-09 — Hero background photos get an accessible label (role=img + aria-label from authored alt)
Source hero photos are decorative CSS backgrounds with NO `<img>`/alt/label. Per request, exposed them to assistive
tech using AUTHORED content: `hero.js` now injects a dedicated empty `<span class="hero-a11y-img" role="img"
aria-label="…">` (label = the authored image's `alt`) into banner + text-up heroes; empty alt → no label (stays
decorative). The label is a SEPARATE element, NOT the block — putting `role="img"` on the block (which holds the H1 +
CTA links) tripped axe's `nested-interactive` rule (caught by `test:a11y`; fixed). `.hero-a11y-img` is visually hidden
(1×1 clip, not display:none so it stays in the a11y tree). Wrote descriptive alt for all 9 hero images (viewed each
source photo to describe accurately — group shots, Tiafoe with players, etc.) into content; uploaded + published.
- **Gotcha (self-inflicted, fixed):** re-uploading the 7 interior heroes with the `/media-da/…` → `content.da.live/
  .{page}/…` shadow-ref swap pointed at shadow folders that didn't yet hold the image bytes → `about:error` on 7 pages.
  Fixed by POSTing each hero's local `content/media-da/…` bytes to its DA shadow folder, then re-publishing; all 9
  heroes now resolve (verified live). Lesson: the shadow-ref swap only works if the image is ALSO uploaded to that
  shadow folder.
- Gates: lint 0 errors · breakpoint ✓ · check:svg ✓ · a11y ✓ (who-we-are, our-impact). **Deploy:** hero.js + hero.css
  = GitHub push (pending); alt text + shadow images = DA (done, live). Live labels appear once the JS deploys.

### 2026-09-09 — News importer fix: Instagram in a col-4 → split-left (was full-width + duplicated)
`robin-montgomery-wimbledon-debut` rendered its Instagram embed FULL-WIDTH **and twice** (same post `p/C9GDWxKPCgG`).
Root cause: `buildSplitLeftSection` only matched embeds in `GridColumn--default--5/6/7`, but this page's IG sits in a
**col-4** beside a **col-8** text column → split detection missed it, so BOTH copies fell through to the full-width
inline handler. Source layout is IG-LEFT / text-RIGHT (a split-left section), one embed.
- Fix (in `import-news-v1.js`): (a) widened the partial-col matcher to **col-4..8**; (b) added **permalink de-dup**
  in `wrapInstagramSections` (the source ships each post twice; the collapsed copy isn't always 0×0, so size-based
  `isHiddenDup` wasn't enough). Only this one page had the dup (audited all 72).
- Re-imported (92.4%), localized (3 imgs, 0 hotlinks), uploaded 3 shadow images + page to DA, published. Verified live
  @1280: IG left (x55→625, 570px) / article text right (x655, 570px), **sideBySide:true**, single embed, real IG card
  hydrates. Backup + manifest SHA refreshed (`8d6faeb0…`). Gates: syntax ✓ · lint 0 errors.

### 2026-09-10 — columns-feature-collage: stray empty <p>s stole flex width (thumbnails 245 not 266)
Homepage "For decades…" collage left-images were too small vs source (thumbnails 245×182 / portrait 272 wide, vs
source 266×199 / 296). Root cause in `columns.js` `decorateFeature`: it removed empty `<p>` wrappers BEFORE moving the
`<picture>`s into the stack/portrait — but the source wraps each `<picture>` in its own `<p>`, so at cleanup time
those `<p>`s still held a picture and were kept; after the pictures were relocated the `<p>`s were left behind as 3
EMPTY flex children in the collage row, stealing ~45px so the stack+portrait couldn't reach their 266/296 flex-grow
targets (grew to 245/272). Fix: run the empty-`<p>` cleanup AFTER relocating the pictures (scoped `:scope > p`).
Verified local vs source: thumb 266×199 (was 245×182), portrait 296×401 (was 272), stack→portrait gap 15, thumbs
touching (gap 0) — exact match at 1600; tablet 768 (thumbs row + portrait below) + 992 intact; no overflow. Gates:
lint 0 · breakpoint ✓ · overflow ✓ (360/768/992/1200/1920). Pure decoration fix (no re-import) — deploys on GitHub push.

### 2026-09-10 — Homepage hero LEARN MORE: width must GROW past 1440 (was capped ~192px)
User DevTools showed source button 238px @1728 vs ours 192px. Earlier fix scaled padding but CAPPED at 31px (~192px
max), so past 1440 ours stopped growing while the source keeps widening. Measured source: it's ~30% of the 50vw text
panel — width grows LINEARLY 150@1200 → 190@1440 → 238@1728 → 270@1920 (≈ 0.1665·vw − 50px). Replaced the ≥1200
padding-clamp with a fluid **`width: calc(16.65vw - 50px)`** (label centered by the base flex rule); base rule
(`padding:14px 10px`, ~150px) covers ≤1200. Verified local vs source exact at every width: 1200:150, 1440:190,
1600:216, 1728:238, 1920:270; vertical gap subhead→button 16px and left edge 189 both match. (Source wraps the `<a>`
in a 56px `<div>` with 8px top/bottom pad, but the rendered button box + 16px gap are identical, so no change needed
there.) Gates: lint 0 · breakpoint ✓ · overflow ✓ (360/768/992/1200/1920). Deploys on GitHub push.

### 2026-09-10 — Related Articles: real dates + news-tags on the 12 related-card articles + helix query
Investigated the source's Related Articles (list-core-component). Findings: (a) it's an AEM tag-list on the single
blanket tag **`usta-foundation`** — no per-topic category exists; (b) the source exposes a real per-article date ONLY
inside related-cards, and it differs from the sitemap `<lastmod>` we imported (a bulk republish stamp); (c) only **12
of 72** articles ever appear as related-cards, so only those 12 have a discoverable real date + carry the tag.
- **Dates:** compared our 12 vs source real dates — 10 already matched, **2 were wrong** (both were the 05-06
  republish stamp): WHM-2026 (Stewart&Robles) May 06→**March 25, 2026**; RFLF-**partner**-to-empo May 06→**April 15,
  2026**. Fixed via a surgical single-row edit of the metadata `Publication Date` (word-diff confirmed only `May 06`→
  the real date changed; related-card dates + body untouched). The RFLF **announce-inaugural** article (Sept 04) is a
  DIFFERENT page and was already correct. The other 60 articles have NO source-verified date anywhere — left as the
  sitemap stamp (the truest value the source offers).
- **Tags:** added a `news-tags` metadata row = `usta-foundation` to exactly those **12** related-card articles (per
  direction — keeps the query pool = the set the source actually surfaces). Verified 12/12.
- **helix-query.yaml:** added `newstags` property to the `news` index (`select: head > meta[name="news-tags"]`) so the
  tag flows into `news-index.json`; the Related Articles feed can then query `newstags contains usta-foundation, minus
  current, limit 3`.
- **Deploy:** helix-query change → GitHub push; the 12 content pages → DA preview/publish (then news-index.json
  regenerates with newstags + corrected dates). Validation draft kept at
  `content/drafts/date-fix-validation/women-s-history-month-2026.plain.html`.

### 2026-09-10 — Performance: PageSpeed 86→ higher via EDS best practices (images, LCP preload, video facade, delayed 3rd-party)
PageSpeed desktop was 86 (LCP 1.6s orange, Speed Index 2.6s red; flags: 206 KiB oversized images, no LCP
fetchpriority, 521 KiB unused JS). Root causes were all in-our-control except the CDN cache/minify flags. Fixes
(all verified locally, no visual regressions, gates green):
- **Oversized collage images (206 KiB):** `columns.js` `capPictureWidth()` caps the collage thumbnails/portrait
  renditions at 600px / 750px (they display ≤266/296px) instead of EDS's default `width=2000`. Renditions verified
  600/750; images stay sharp (native 512/613px).
- **Hero LCP (fetchpriority flag):** `hero.js` `preloadHeroImage()` injects `<link rel=preload as=image
  fetchpriority=high>` for the hero's background rendition (derived from the AUTHORED image — still fully content
  -managed; swap the image and the preload follows). Applied to banner + text-up. Verified preload href === hero bg URL.
- **YouTube unused JS (biggest lever):** replaced the eager iframe with a **click-to-load facade** (poster thumbnail
  + play button; real iframe injected on click with autoplay). Verified: **0 YouTube player scripts before click**
  (was ~8), 8 load only on click. Facade is a keyboard-accessible `<button aria-label>`; a11y ✓.
- **Delayed 3rd-party:** wrapped `loadDelayed()` in a 3s `setTimeout` (EDS convention) so the FundraiseUp donate tab
  (15 scripts) + consent gate load AFTER interactive. Verified 0 FundraiseUp requests in first 1.5s, loads after 3s
  (tab still appears). Remaining PageSpeed flags (minify CSS 27 KiB, cache lifetimes 60 KiB) are platform/CDN-managed,
  not code.
- Gates: lint 0 · breakpoint ✓ · overflow ✓ · a11y ✓. Deploys on GitHub push (hero.js, columns.js/css, scripts.js).

### 2026-09-10 — Mobile perf: responsive hero rendition (LCP 3.2s → fix; desktop already 100)
Desktop hit 100; mobile 93 (only orange metric: LCP 3.2s; top insight "improve image delivery 157 KiB"). Cause: the
hero LCP background still requested a flat `width=2000` even on a 360px phone (~124 KiB of the 157). Fix in `hero.js`:
`heroRenditionWidth()` sizes the full-bleed rendition to `viewport × DPR`, snapped to CDN-friendly buckets
[750,1000,1600,2000]; `heroBgUrlAt()` applies it to BOTH the background AND the preload. Verified: mobile 360/DPR2 →
**width=750** (was 2000, need ~720), desktop 1400 → 1600, wide 1920 → 2000 — sharp at every size (mobile screenshot
confirmed no blur), still author-managed. Applied to banner + text-up heroes.
- Remaining mobile flags (render-blocking 140ms, minify CSS 27 KiB / JS 9 KiB, unused CSS 10 KiB, cache 13 KiB) are
  EDS PLATFORM/CDN-controlled: head.html is the standard boilerplate (untouchable), one critical styles.css, aem.js +
  scripts.js as modules; production CDN minifies + sets cache headers (the aem.page preview does not). Not code-fixable.
- Gates: lint 0 · breakpoint ✓ · overflow ✓. Deploys on GitHub push (hero.js).

**MIGRATION STATUS:** all general-template + specialized pages imported; financials PDFs **live on DA**. Full-site
link + breadcrumb validation PASSED (see `VALIDATION.md`). Outstanding: **2 PDFs** localized locally, pending DA
upload (blocked on the credential opt-in). Only **404.html** (T7, hero-error) remains unmigrated from the full scope.

---

## 🔴 HANDOFF — who-we-are (general template): OPEN TASKS for next session

**Status:** All code fixes are COMMITTED LOCALLY (HEAD `7c1395f`, 3 unpushed commits:
`3a1375f`, `a6caa93`, `7c1395f`) but **NOT DEPLOYED**. Working tree clean.

### ⛔ BLOCKER #1 (do this FIRST) — deploy the code
The **deployed `styles.css` is 34 lines; local is 938** — NONE of the CSS work
(button override, yellow band, medium/wide widths, hero text-up, columns spacing)
has reached aem.live. Content/HTML deploys via Document Authoring (so the live
page shows correct BLOCKS) but ALL CSS comes from GitHub → aem.live code-sync,
and `git push` fails with `could not read Username for 'https://github.com'`
(GitHub push opt-in is OFF). The GitHub remote `main` is still at `030eb3c`.

**Action:** ask the user to enable **Settings → LLM Permissions → GitHub push**
(token added THERE, never in chat). Then:
```
git push origin main
```
Wait ~1–2 min for code-sync, then VERIFY the deploy actually landed:
```
curl -s https://main--foundation-usta--aemdemos.aem.live/styles/styles.css | wc -l   # expect ~938, not 34
curl -s https://main--foundation-usta--aemdemos.aem.live/styles/styles.css | grep -c "body.general main a.button"  # expect >0
```
DO NOT try to diagnose "button still black / not centered" until this shows the
new CSS is live — the reported bugs are almost certainly just the stale 34-line CSS.

### After deploy — verify these fixes actually render (measure vs source, all viewports)
Source: https://www.ustafoundation.com/en/home/who-we-are.html
Live:   https://main--foundation-usta--aemdemos.aem.live/en/home/who-we-are
1. **LEARN MORE buttons** must be SOLID BLUE (#0373f3 / rgb(3,115,243)), white,
   3px radius, 18px — NOT black. (Override `body.general main a.button*` at
   specificity 0,3,3 beats `.primary` 0,3,1; verified computes to source blue when
   the CSS is present.) Both LEARN MOREs (leadership + supporters).
2. **Yellow band** — "Our Leadership and Staff" intro CENTERED (heading + para +
   button), Evert photo-left + quote + BOLD "Chris Evert, Chairperson" to the
   right; whole band full-bleed #FFEFBE; ~40px gap between intro and Evert columns.
3. **Hero (text-up)** mobile — panel 56vw, band height 708/625/625/601 @360/390/430/500.
4. **Section widths** — intro `medium` (970 @1200), supporters `wide` (1170 @1200), centered.
5. **Trailing black band** above the footer present.
Then run gates on the LIVE url: `npm run check:overflow <url>`,
`npm run check:typography <url>`, `npm run test:a11y <url>`. Paste output.

### Then — migrate the remaining "general"-template pages (SAME importer)
The importer is built ONCE per template; these share who-we-are's block vocabulary.
For each: add to `tools/importer/urls-general.txt`, re-bundle if the script changed
(esbuild + re-prepend `/* eslint-disable */`), run the bulk-import runner, then
`node tools/assets/localize-assets.mjs <page>.plain.html`, verify, log here.
- what-we-do.html        (hero text-up + columns/cards — measure)
- get-involved.html      (hero text-up)
- our-impact.html        (hero BANNER/center, not text-up — confirm which)
- who-we-are/financials.html
- what-we-do/college-scholarship-opportunities.html
- get-involved/special-funds.html
- get-involved/special-funds/chris-evert-50th-anniversary.html  (quote block 32px lives here)
- get-involved/young-professional-initiative.html
- news.html (listing) ; 404.html
NOTE: `our-impact` + `home` use hero CENTER (banner); who-we-are/what-we-do/
get-involved use hero TOP (text-up). Pick the variant per page.

### Key files (this template)
- Importer: `tools/importer/import-general-v1.js` (+ `.bundle.js`); backup +
  manifest in `tools/importer/backups/general/` (SHA `2d90c83…`).
- Hero variant: `blocks/hero/hero.{js,css}` (`text-up`); `banner`/`error` untouched.
- Section styles: `styles/styles.css` — `medium`/`wide` widths, `section-yellow`
  + `yellow-center-intro`, `body.general` button override, `body.leadership`.
- Cards tiles / columns tweaks: `blocks/cards/cards.css`, `blocks/columns/columns.css`.

### Gotchas learned
- Dev server serves `/en/**` from the DA preview bus, NOT local files → new pages
  404 locally until pushed to DA; CSS only updates via GitHub push. Verify on aem.live.
- `decorateButtons` (scripts.js) only buttonizes `<p><a>` wrapped in `<strong>`/`<em>`.
- SVG-wrapped raster headshots must be rasterized before DA (409). (leadership page.)

### 2026-09-14 — News: `six-student-athletes…tiafoe-fund` video was WRONGLY split-right → re-imported full-width
The YouTube video on `/en/home/news/six-student-athletes-awarded-first-grants-frances-tiafoe-fund` rendered as a
`split-right` section (video beside the paragraph). Source truth: the embed sits in a **full-width `aem-GridColumn--default--12`**
column BELOW the text, so it must be a plain full-width `video-embed` block — NO split. The page was originally imported
by an older importer; the CURRENT `import-news-v1.js` `wrapVideoSections()` already routes col-12 videos to the `else`
(full-width) branch, so **no code change was needed** — a clean single-page re-import fixed it (per Content-Import Rule:
re-import, don't hand-edit block structure).
- Steps: re-bundled `import-news-v1.js` → single-URL `run-bulk-import.js --force` (94.7% completeness) →
  `localize-assets` (3 imgs downloaded, 0 hotlinks). Verified local `.plain.html`: 0 `split-right`, single `video-embed`,
  all other blocks intact (columns media-right, social, reactions, cards news / related-articles).
- **Re-import gotcha:** a fresh import does NOT re-emit the manually-added `news-tags: usta-foundation` metadata row
  (that's a documented post-import manual edit for the Related-Articles query pool — see the 2026-09-10 dates/tags entry).
  Re-added it by hand after import. Corrected related-card dates (Mar 25 / Apr 15) survived the re-import.
- **NOT YET LIVE:** localhost `/en/**` + aem.live serve from the DA preview bus, so the fix only appears once the page is
  uploaded/published to DA (outward-facing — on user request). Local file is corrected and verified.

### 2026-09-14 — Home "Ready on the court" mission band: left-aligned + wider (center,narrow → medium)
Per request + source measurement, the homepage "Ready on the court. Ready for life." mission band was `center, narrow`
(text-centered, capped 810px). Source is actually LEFT-aligned copy on a wider measure — the p grows to ~1090px @1920
(vs our 810 cap). Changed the section style to **`medium`** (708 @768 → 772 @992 → 970 @1200): dropping `center` makes the
text left-aligned (only `.center` sets `text-align:center`; `.medium` just centers the column via `margin-inline:auto`),
and `medium` is the "just wider than narrow" step. No CSS change — reused the existing `medium` width tokens (same band
used for who-we-are mission intro). Content-only edit in `content/en/home.plain.html`.
- **NOT YET LIVE:** homepage content serves from the DA preview bus (localhost + aem.live), so this appears only after the
  page is re-uploaded/published to DA (outward-facing — on user request).

### 2026-09-14 (rev) — Home: correct the two mission/collage sections (supersedes same-day entry above)
Clarified the two asks after user feedback:
1. **"Ready on the court" band** stays **CENTERED**, just needs to be **wider** than `narrow` (source p grows to ~1090
   @1920 vs our 810 cap). Final style = **`center, medium`** (was `center, narrow`). Content edit in
   `content/index.plain.html` (the `index` DA doc = the live homepage; `content/en/home.plain.html` is NOT what `/`
   serves — earlier I edited the wrong file). **NOT live until the index page is published to DA.**
2. **"For decades" collage body text** was **centered** but the SOURCE **left-aligns** it at desktop. Root cause: the
   base `.columns.feature p { text-align:center }` (correct for the mobile stacked layout) was not overridden when the
   collage goes two-column at ≥768. Added a scoped override:
   `.columns.feature:has(.columns-feature-collage) .columns-feature-row > div:not(.columns-feature-collage) p { text-align:left }`.
   Verified: mobile 390 = center (source), tablet 768 + desktop 1920 = left (source). This is a **CSS** fix → shows in
   local preview immediately; deploys via GitHub push.
- **Preview gotcha reconfirmed:** the dev server serves the homepage HTML from the DA content bus, so CONTENT edits
  (the `center, medium` style) don't appear locally until DA publish; CSS edits DO appear locally.
- Gates: stylelint ✓ (columns.css) · breakpoint-check ✓ (768/992/1200 min-width only).

### 2026-09-14 — cards-support: left-align card body at desktop (was centered at all widths)
The homepage "Your support makes a difference." cards-support block centered the card title, description AND LEARN MORE
at every width. Re-measured the SOURCE: mobile (390) IS centered (single-column stack), but desktop (≥768, 4-up) is
**LEFT-aligned** — title/desc/CTA all share the image's left edge (135 @1440). The old CSS + comment ("centered at ALL
widths") was wrong. Fix in `blocks/cards/cards.css` @768 block: set `text-align:left` on `.cards.support > ul > li` and
its `.cards-support-card-body h4` (the base mobile rules keep center < 768). Verified local: mobile 390 = center; desktop
1440 = left, title/desc/CTA + image all at left 135 (exact source match). CSS fix → visible in local preview; deploys via
GitHub push. Gates: stylelint ✓ · breakpoint-check ✓.

### 2026-09-14 — sync `en/home` doc to match index (center, medium)
Applied the same "Ready on the court" fix to `content/en/home.plain.html` (the `en/home` DA doc) as to `index`:
style `medium` → **`center, medium`** (centered + wider than narrow). Both homepage docs now identical for this section.
Content change → needs DA publish to appear in preview/live.

### 2026-09-15 — cards-news: images cropped to 2:1 → let them use natural aspect ratio (source parity)
Related-Articles teaser images looked "flattened/cut" vs source (reported on the Agassi news page). Root cause in
`blocks/cards/cards.css`: `.cards.news .cards-news-card-image img` forced `aspect-ratio: 2 / 1` + `object-fit: cover`,
which CROPS any image that isn't 2:1. The SOURCE renders each teaser at its OWN natural ratio (height:auto, object-fit
default): most are 400×200 (2:1) but some are taller, e.g. the "2026 Game Changer Award" image is 400×267 (~1.5:1).
Fix: removed the forced `aspect-ratio` + `object-fit:cover` so intrinsic ratio drives height (matches source). Verified
local @1440 vs source: Donnelly 2.000 (190h), Game Changer 1.498 (254h, uncropped now), Opening Night 2.000 (190h) —
exact ratio match; titles stagger like the source. No other tier forces a ratio (768/992 only touch flex/width). CSS fix
→ visible in local preview; deploys via GitHub push. Gates: stylelint ✓ · breakpoint-check ✓.

### 2026-09-15 — Donate form: native FundraiseUp INLINE EMBED auto-activates (custom-form-donate block NOT needed)
User observation confirmed: the Chris-Evert-50th donation form is a FundraiseUp **inline embed** that hydrates
AUTOMATICALLY — no custom block required. Source markup is just a hidden anchor inside an embed container:
`<div class="cmp-embed"><center><a href="#XJYDXZPC" style="display:none"></a></center></div>`. The FundraiseUp loader
(already loaded site-wide by `scripts/donate.js`) scans the document for an `<a href="#<ElementID>">` and REPLACES it
in place with the live donation iframe. `XJYDXZPC` is this form's FundraiseUp element ID (maps to the CHRIS50 campaign
in the FRU dashboard).
- **Test page:** `content/drafts/donate-widget-test/chris-evert-native-embed.plain.html` — content is just
  `<p><a href="#XJYDXZPC">…</a></p>` (plus copy). Local URL (new draft folders serve under the `/content/` prefix):
  `http://localhost:3000/content/drafts/donate-widget-test/chris-evert-native-embed`.
- **Result:** after the delayed phase loads FRU (~3s), the anchor is consumed and replaced by the REAL FRU iframe
  (`iframe#XJYDXZPC`, title "Donation Form", 698px): freq toggle, "Celebrating a Champion!", six $50 tiers, custom
  amount, dedicate + honoree, "Designate to the Jimmy Evert Merit Scholarship Fund", "Donate and Support" — exact source
  match, fully interactive. It hydrated even on **localhost** (the old `custom-form-donate.js` comment claimed the FRU
  account is domain-restricted to prod; that did NOT block the inline embed here).
- **Implication / next step (not yet applied to the live page):** the real Chris-Evert page
  (`content/en/home/get-involved/special-funds/chris-evert-50th-anniversary.plain.html`) can DROP the hand-built
  `custom-form-donate` block and instead author the FRU inline-embed anchor `<a href="#XJYDXZPC">`, letting the widget
  activate itself (source-faithful, less code to maintain). The `split-even` section (quote left / form right) still
  applies — the anchor/iframe just replaces the block in the right column. Leave `custom-form-donate` block in the repo
  until the page is re-authored + published to DA (outward-facing, on request).
- **Dev-server gotcha:** `aem up` caches its content-file listing at startup — brand-new draft files 404 until restart;
  and locally-authored drafts serve under `/content/…` (bare `/drafts/…` proxies to aem.page). A stray probe file
  `content/drafts/block-samples/_donate-native-probe.plain.html` was created during testing; deletion is hook-blocked,
  so it remains (noindex, harmless) pending the content pipeline.

### 2026-09-15 — Chris Evert page: exact copy under drafts/meet with custom-form-donate → native FRU embed (VERIFIED)
On a feature branch, copied the LIVE Chris-Evert page
(`content/en/home/get-involved/special-funds/chris-evert-50th-anniversary.plain.html`) verbatim to
`content/drafts/meet/chris-evert-50th-anniversary.plain.html`, changing ONLY the donation piece: removed the
`custom-form-donate` block and dropped in the native FundraiseUp inline-embed anchor `<p><a href="#XJYDXZPC"></a></p>`
in the same `split-even` section (quote left / form right). Everything else identical (h1 center intro, columns text+photo,
quote block, spacer band, metadata).
- **Verified @1440 on localhost** (`/content/drafts/meet/chris-evert-50th-anniversary`): after the delayed phase loads FRU,
  the anchor is consumed and replaced by the REAL FRU iframe (`iframe#XJYDXZPC`, "Donation Form", 698px) — full form
  (freq toggle, "Celebrating a Champion!", six $50 tiers, custom amount, dedicate+honoree, "Designate to the Jimmy Evert
  Merit Scholarship Fund", "Donate and Support"). `custom-form-donate` block absent; `split-even` still holds quote left
  (x135) + form right (x735), side-by-side. So the real page can drop the block and use the native embed anchor 1:1.
- **Dev-server note:** `aem up` must be started with `nohup … &` (NOT setsid/disown, which the harness reaps); it caches
  the content listing at startup so new drafts need a restart, and locally-authored drafts serve under `/content/…`.

### 2026-09-15 — split-even: center the native FRU embed in its column + top-align (source-parity positioning)
On the drafts/meet Chris-Evert test, the native FRU donation iframe was flush-LEFT in its split-even column and sat +14px
low vs the quote. Source truth (measured @1440): the form is CENTERED within its 570px column (the source wraps it in a
`<center>` → iframe at left 832 / right 1208) and its TOP aligns exactly with the quote (delta 0). Fixed in `styles.css`
split-even rules (CSS only — no content change):
  • `main .section.split-even > .default-content-wrapper:last-child { text-align:center }` — centers the inline-embed
    iframe in its column at every viewport (and in the single content column on mobile). `:last-child` also lifts
    specificity above the earlier `.center-intro` rule (avoids stylelint no-descending-specificity — see css-pitfalls-eds).
  • inside the @768 block: `…split-even > .default-content-wrapper > p:first-child { margin-top:0 }` — zeroes the leading
    paragraph's block margin so the embed top-aligns with the quote (kills the +14px offset).
- Verified vs source: @1440 form left 832/right 1208, topDelta 0 (exact match); @992 centered (left 558) topDelta 0;
  @390 form fills the 328 column, stacked below quote (source stacks on mobile too). Gates: stylelint ✓ · breakpoint ✓.
- Scoped to `.default-content-wrapper` so a block-based split-even column (e.g. quote+quote) is unaffected.

### 2026-09-15 — split-even donate: theme-scope decision + form-load-speed analysis
Two follow-up questions on the native FRU embed:
1. **"Theme: general → should the CSS live in general.css?"** No general.css exists — and shouldn't. In `aem.js`
   `decorateTemplateAndTheme()`, **Theme** metadata only ADDS a body class (`body.general`); it does NOT load a
   stylesheet. Only **Template** loads `templates/<name>/<name>.css` (e.g. news). Convention here: theme-scoped rules
   live in `styles.css` under `body.general …` (already ~30 lines of button-COLOR rules). Tried scoping the split-even
   layout rules to `body.general`, but **reverted**: (a) the layout follows from the section style + content shape, not
   the theme; (b) `Theme`→body-class only happens on the aem.live pipeline — the LOCAL dev server does NOT emit
   `<meta name=theme>` for drafts, so `body.general` is absent locally and a body.general scope silently no-ops in
   preview (confirmed: draft body class = "appear" only; live page body = "general appear"). Kept the rules scoped to
   `.section.split-even > .default-content-wrapper` (structure-based, verifiable locally, robust to theme changes).
2. **"Form takes time to load — do we need an EDS Embed block to make it fast?"** Measured: the FRU widget script is
   requested at **~3.16s** (the delayed phase = `loadDelayed()` behind a 3s setTimeout in scripts.js), downloads in
   ~29ms, and the inline form hydrates immediately after. So the ~3s delay is INTENTIONAL and CORRECT for perf — FRU is
   a heavy 3rd-party (loads its own script + nested iframes + Stripe); loading it eagerly would tank LCP/TBT (the home
   PageSpeed work in the 2026-09-10 entry specifically pushed FRU into the delayed phase for this reason). An EDS Embed
   BLOCK would NOT make it faster — it'd still load the same FRU script; a block that loaded FRU eagerly would be
   SLOWER. The right perf pattern is what we have (delayed 3rd-party) — optionally we could reserve the ~698px height
   with a min-height placeholder to avoid layout shift when it hydrates (CLS), but that's a polish, not a speed win.
   Conclusion: keep the native inline embed on the delayed FRU loader; no Embed block needed.

### 2026-09-15 — donate-embed BLOCK (plain FRU anchor doesn't survive publishing → carry the ID as text)
CONFIRMED on the deployed branch preview (issue7-widget…aem.live/drafts/meet/chris-evert-50th-anniversary): the plain
authored anchor `<a href="#XJYDXZPC">` does NOT work post-publish — the pipeline strips the FRAGMENT-only href down to
`/` (same failure mode donate.js documents for query-only `?form=` hrefs), so FundraiseUp never sees element ID
`XJYDXZPC` and the form never hydrates. It only worked on the LOCAL dev server (which preserves the raw href).
- **Fix — new `donate-embed` block** (`blocks/donate-embed/{js,css}`): authoring contract is ONE cell holding the FRU
  element ID as PLAIN TEXT (`| Donate Embed | / | XJYDXZPC |`) — text survives publishing where an href fragment does
  not. `decorate()` extracts the ID (from text, or a surviving `#…` href, or a pasted source snippet) and re-creates the
  `<a href="#<ID>">` placeholder at decorate time (well before the delayed-phase FRU loader runs), so the widget
  hydrates it exactly as on the source. Anchor is visually-hidden (clip-path inset, NOT display:none — the widget needs
  it in the tree). Block CSS centers the ~376px iframe in its column (source `<center>`); split-even top-alignment comes
  from the existing `div[class$='-wrapper'] + div[class$='-wrapper'] { margin-top:0 }` rule (both columns are now blocks:
  quote + donate-embed). Removed the earlier `.default-content-wrapper` split-even rules (obsolete — embed is a block now).
- Verified LOCAL @1440: block extracts XJYDXZPC → anchor → FRU hydrates → form left 832/right 1208, topDelta 0 (source
  match). Gates: lint 0 errors (7 pre-existing no-console WARNINGS in tests/a11y, unrelated) · stylelint ✓ · breakpoint ✓.
- **Authoring contract for the real page:** replace the `custom-form-donate` block with a `donate-embed` block whose one
  cell is the FRU element ID (`XJYDXZPC` for CHRIS50). Keep the `split-even` section (quote + donate-embed).
- **PENDING pipeline proof:** block CODE deploys via git push to the branch; the DRAFT CONTENT (now using the block) is
  git-ignored and lives on DA — the branch preview still serves the OLD anchor content until the updated draft is
  published to DA. Must re-verify hydration on the branch preview AFTER the content is on DA.

### 2026-09-15 — donate-embed: eager load + firm height (fast form, zero CLS)
Two perf/UX refinements to the donate-embed block:
1. **Eager load** — the donation form is the page's PRIMARY content, so the block now triggers the FundraiseUp loader
   itself at decorate time (eager phase) instead of waiting for the site-wide delayed phase (~3s). Exported
   `loadFundraiseUp()` from `scripts/donate.js` (idempotent — guards on `window.FundraiseUp`, and now installs the
   Trusted-Types frame hardening itself so an eager caller gets a working widget); `donate-embed.js` imports + calls it.
   The delayed-phase call in scripts.js stays as a harmless no-op for other pages. Verified: FRU script requested at
   **~384ms** (was ~3160ms) — form hydrates ~8× sooner. (Other pages keep the delayed behaviour — this is scoped to
   pages that actually have the block.)
2. **Firm height / no CLS** — reserved the form's rendered height on the block so nothing shifts when the iframe
   hydrates, at every viewport. Measured on the live widget: **716px mobile (<768)** (328-wide form; honoree tooltip
   wraps) and **698px from 768 up**. Set as `min-height` in `blocks/donate-embed/donate-embed.css` (min, not fixed, so
   the form can grow if FRU ever gets taller). Verified: reservedBefore==formHeight at 390 (716) and 1440 (698) → zero
   layout movement.
- Gates: lint 0 errors (7 pre-existing no-console warnings in tests/a11y, unrelated) · stylelint ✓ · breakpoint ✓.
- eslint: donate.js now has one named export → added a scoped `import/prefer-default-export` disable (the module is
  side-effecting/self-running, so a named export is correct — not a default).

### 2026-09-15 — Retire custom-form-donate block; migrate all pages + samples to donate-embed
Now that donate-embed is proven, removed the hand-built block and switched everything over:
- **Deleted** `blocks/custom-form-donate/` (js+css) — replaced by `donate-embed`.
- **Real page** `content/en/home/get-involved/special-funds/chris-evert-50th-anniversary.plain.html`: swapped the
  `custom-form-donate` table for `| Donate Embed | / | XJYDXZPC |` in the same split-even section (quote + donate-embed).
- **Block sample:** added `content/drafts/block-samples/donate-embed.plain.html` (new library sample, element ID
  XJYDXZPC, explains the text-carries-the-ID rationale + firm-height/no-CLS note). Repointed the old
  `custom-form-donate.plain.html` sample to the donate-embed block with a "retired → see Donate Embed" note so it isn't
  left unstyled.
- **Section sample:** `content/drafts/sections-samples/section-split-even-donate.plain.html` — donate cell now uses the
  donate-embed block; updated the descriptive copy (`custom-form-donate` → `donate-embed`).
- **a11y config:** `tests/a11y/a11y.config.js` — `/drafts/block-samples/custom-form-donate` → `/drafts/block-samples/donate-embed`.
- **Importer:** `tools/importer/import-chris-evert-v1.js` now emits a `Donate Embed` block (one cell = element ID
  XJYDXZPC) instead of the old 5-row Custom Form Donate table, so a re-import reproduces the new markup. (+ comment fixes.)
- Verified LOCAL: block sample @390 decorates → form hydrates (716px reserved == form height, no shift), no
  `.custom-form-donate` in DOM. Gates: lint 0 errors · breakpoint ✓. (a11y test harness Chromium isn't installed in
  this env — config change is a URL swap only; verify a11y where the harness runs.)
- **Deploy:** block deletion + a11y config + importer = git push (block code already committed). The 3 CONTENT files are
  git-ignored (live on DA) — must be re-published to DA for the real page + samples to show the new block.
